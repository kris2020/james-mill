                    <p>Much of this section seems to have come from material read at any time from
                        the late 1800s to 1818 (Mercier de la Rivière). Mill’s interest in Hartley
                            (<ref target="cpb3ch1scrap16v">16v</ref>) was rekindled in the
                        mid-1810-20 period, the Destutt de Tracy (<ref target="cpb3ch1scrap16v"
                            >16v</ref>) could not have been read before 1815. There is
                            <emph>some</emph> sign of a change of hand in the last paragraph of the
                        whole, but not sufficient enough to suggest that it was written in the
                        post-1825 period.</p>

                    <p>“Are you not sensible, Hylas, that two things must concur to take away all
                        scruple, and work a plenary assent in the mind? Let a visible object be set
                        in never so clear a light, yet if there is any imperfection in the sight, or
                        if the eye is not directed towards it, it will not be distinctly seen. And
                        though a demonstration be never so well grounded, and fairly proposed, yet
                        if there is withal a stain of prejudice, or a strong bias on the
                        understanding, can it be expected on [a] sudden to perceive clearly and
                        adhere firmly to the truth? No, there is need of time and pains: the
                        attention must be awakened and detained by a frequent repetition of the same
                        thing placed oft in the same, oft in different lights.” Berkley, Bishop of

                    <p><emph>That we often use Words without attending to the Meaning.</emph> “If we
                        use a term repeatedly we think we understand it sufficiently even if we do
                        not think about the idea corresponding to it. The truth of this assertion is
                        obvious from experience. For if we hear a term for the first time, we
                        immediately ask what it can mean. But when we have thought more often about
                        the idea corresponding to it, when we hear the term we are not worried about
                        that idea any more. It is enough for us to remember the term, to have
                        thought about the idea corresponding to it in the past, and so it is not a
                        sound without meaning. So we pour out lots of words in continuous discourse
                        without thinking about the ideas corresponding to each—something which
                        cannot be done on the spot at the speed with which the words are uttered.”

                    <p>An instructive attempt to prove, that among those cases in which we fancy we
                        have notions, or ideas, when we really have none, is that of the word <hi

                            <emph>notio deceptorsi</emph> [deceptive notion]; it is, therefore, “an
                        empty term of which we seem to have some concept or notion when in fact we
                        have none.” [L] <emph>Ib.</emph>, § 136, p. 179 and § 137, p. 180. A very

                    <p>“Aristotle, the most wide-ranging, profound, and truly philosophical mind of
                        all antiquity, was the first to carry the torch of exact analysis into the
                        sphere of philosophy and the arts. Unveiling the principles of certitude and
                        the springs of feeling, he subjected the development of reason and even the
                        fire of genius to exact rules.” [F] Turgot, Discours sur le[s] Progrés

                        truer estimate, than that of the Scotch philosophers, borrowed from one
                        another, without knowledge of the subject! <note>(11/12/1750), <emph>Turgot

                            without waiting to discover how their desires may be realized, dismiss
                            that topic to save themselves the labour of deliberating about
                            possibilities and impossibilities, assume their wish fulfilled, and
                            proceed to work out the details in imagination, and to take pleasure in
                            portraying what they will do when it is realized, thus making still more
                            idle a mind that is idle without that.” (Loeb 455.)</note></p>

                        found in many respects among men, there are in them two common driving
                        powers which put them all in action: an appetite for pleasures and an
                        aversion to pain are these common driving forces which belong to our
                        constitution, and which are the principles of all our movements. To wish
                        that men act in a contrary sense to the impression of these driving forces,
                        is to pretend to change the immutable order of nature. This is to propose to
                        make the effects independent of their causes.” [F] Mercier de la Riviere,

                        nomenclature decides upon the ideas, with respect to both extent and
                        discrimination.</p>
                    <p><emph>Association.</emph> The business of life consists in associating
                        objects, according to Hume’s three heads, contiguity in time and place,
                        causation, and resemblance: The first subservient to all historical
                        knowledge—the second to all production of effects—the third to all the
                        embellishments which arise from the imagination. Query, whether any hint can
                        be got from this, towards Encyclopedical arrangement. For the observation
                        see Darwin’s <emph>Zoomania</emph>, Sect. 10, 3. <note>Hume, <emph>A
                                Treatise of Human Nature</emph>, p. 27, B. I, P. I, § 4; Erasmus
                            Darwin, <emph>Zoomania</emph>, 1801, I 66, § 10, ss. 3, sss. 3. “Nor
                            should we wonder to find them thus connected together, since it is the
                            business of our lives to dispose them into these three classes; and we
                            become valuable to ourselves and our friends, as we succeed in it. Those
                            who have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time
                            or place, are men learned in the history of mankind, and of the sciences
                            they have cultivated. Those who have connected a great class of ideas of
                            resemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and oratory,
                            and of all rational analogy. While those who have connected great
                            classes of ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of
                            producing effects. These are the men of active wisdom, who lead armies
                            to victory, and kingdoms to prosperity, or discover and improve the
                            sciences, which meliorate and adorn the condition of
                        humanity.”</note></p>
                    <p><emph>Virtue.</emph> This very general word is usefully distributed by Plato;
                        who speaks of it as a quality of various things. It is a quality, he says,
                        which may [be] predicated of every thing, of which there is any work. Thus
                        we say, there is a work of a horse. In general we say, that that is the work
                        of any thing, which either that thing alone can do, or better than any other
                        thing; thus seeing is the work of the eye, hearing of the ear, because those
                        are the works of only those organs, and walking is the work of the feet,
                        though some persons can walk with their hands. Now each of these things
                        which has a work, has also a virtue by which they do the work, the eyes by
                        the virtue of seeing; and without which virtue they could not do it. This of
                        every thing. Consider now the soul. It has a work: such as that of
                        remembering, deliberating, etc. And also that of living. These works it does
                        well, by its virtue, ill if it want the virtue. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>

                        4, p. 31, says, “Logic teaches us to produce correct judgements, and to make
                        a series of judgements, that is to say, rational inferences.” [F] The last
                        part of this definition is exact, and corresponds exactly to the ancient
                        Logic, the Syllogystic. The first is, in one sense, knowledge, in the
                        largest acceptation of the term. It is knowledge which in one sense enables
                        [us] to make all correct judgements. If judgement means correct
                        propositions, it only means correspondence in the meaning of words.

                        signs. When you have made one sign to stand for a certain number of ideas in

                        great jump in knowledge at once. In thus substituting signs for things—see
                        the immense advantage. Things, distant, unmanageable, cannot except in small
                        numbers, be brought together to be compared, to find which agree, and which
                        do not agree. If comparisons could only be made by means of the things
                        themselves, the number of agreements and disagreements possible to be found
                        out by any man would be small indeed. Not so, when signs are substituted;
                        comparisons with them may be made in great numbers. That very

                    <p><emph>The Formal and Efficient Causes.</emph>—[“In order] not to confound the
                        questions, where one ought to reply by the formal cause, with those, where
                        one ought to reply with the efficient cause; and of not deriving the formal
                        cause from the formal cause, which is a source of many errors, but to reply
                        then with the efficient cause. One understands this better with an example.
                        One asks me why this piece of lead is round; I can reply with the definition
                        of roundness (which is to reply with the formal cause) by saying that it is
                        because, if one conceives the straight lines, drawn from all the points of
                        the surface from which one wishes to draw them to a certain point of the
                        side of that piece of lead, they are all equal. But, if one continues to ask
                        how is it that the exterior surface of this lead is such as I have just
                        described, and why is it not arranged as it ought to be so that this lead
                        makes a cube, a Peripatetic will seek another formal cause by saying that it
                        is owing to that lead having received a new quality called roundness, which
                        has been drawn from the bosom of its matter in order to make it round, and
                        which does not have any other quality, which would make it a cube. But good
                        sense ought to respond with the efficient cause, by saying that the exterior
                        surface of the piece of lead is such as one has just said, because being
                        cast, it has been put in an empty mould, in which the concave surface was
                        such that it ought to make the lead convex such as was requisite in order
                        that all its points, etc.” [F] Arnauld, <emph>Des vrais et des Fausses

                            societies of agriculture, either in France or England, but I am much in
                            doubt with myself whether, when best conducted, they do most good or
                            mischief; that is, whether the benefits a national agriculture may by
                            great chance owe to them are not more than counterbalanced by the harm
                            they effect; by turning the public attention to frivolous objects,
                            instead of important ones, or dressing important ones in such a garb as
                            to make them trifles? The only society that could be really useful would
                            be that which in the culture of a large farm, should exhibit a perfect
                            example of good husbandry.” Quoted from George Ensor, <emph>On National
                                Education</emph>, 1811, pp. 122-3. This is an exceedingly rare book.
                            Ensor quotes the passage from Young above with the following remark.
                            “How frivolous are most of the disputes of such societies! Most
                            ridiculous accounts have been given of those which frequently occupied
                            the French academicians: and have not the English surpassed them? … and
                            all the follies done and said, and at vast expense to the nation, by
                            these triflers, who are acting satirists on the frivolity of
                            children.”</note></p>
                    <p>The English universities are all for teaching poetry, yet of all our great
                        poets, how few have been reared in the universities—Milton despised the

                        Akenside—At the present day, Campbel, Scott, Southey, not of the

                            probably to Thomas Campbell, 1777-1844, a supporter of the University of

                            Campbell, d.1817. Sir Richard Blackmore, 1655-1729, a dull, if learned,
                            poet, and Mark Akenside, 1721-70, are also referred to.</note></p>

                    <p>Bernier tells us, that when the preceptor of Aurungzebe, upon the elevation
                        of that emperor to the throne, wanted to be raised to a high post in the
                        government, Aurungzebe reproached him with having taught him many things
                        frivolous or useless, but hardly any thing useful. “If you had taught me,”
                        said he, “that philosophy which adapts the mind to reason, and will not
                        suffer it to rest satisfied with anything short of the most solid arguments
                        … I should be infinitely indebted to you.” [F] Bernier, <emph>Evenemens
                            Particuliers des Etats du Mogol</emph>, p. 64. Teaching a mind “<hi

                            solid arguments</hi>,” [F] is a most important point of education. The
                        English education is expressly calculated for the very opposite effect. It
                        accustoms the youthful mind, throughout, to pay itself with nothing but
                        false and frivolous reason—in the first place, the whole of the wretched
                        reasonings of the Church of England about religion—the trinity—original
                        sin—miracles, etc., etc.,—next the silly reasonings of Aristotle in morals
                        and politics—its accomodations of authority—distrust of the human mind,
                        etc., etc. The strength of the human mind consists in two things; 1. in
                        making present to itself with rapidity, all the true reasons which apply to
                        each particular case; 2. in discerning the infirmity of such as are falsely
                        pretended to apply [to] it.—The discipline of an English University tends
                        not to forward, but to prevent both species of strength. <note>François

                        be too proud to work. They are comparative advantages only that make men

                        no longer learning; it has the appearance of something which we have

                    <p>“The understanding of the Germans and their character appear to have no
                        communication with each other: the one cannot suffer any limits, the other
                        is subject to every yoke; the one is very enterprising, the other very
                        timid: in short, the enlightenment of the one seldom gives strength to the
                        other, and this is easily explained. The extension of knowledge in modern
                        times only serves to weaken the character, when it is not strengthened by
                        the practice of business and the exercise of the will. To see all, and to
                        comprehend all, is a great cause of uncertainty; and the energy of action
                        develops only in those free and powerful countries where patriotic
                        sentiments are to the soul like blood to the veins, and grow cold only with

                        light-house might justly be imputed the calamities of ship wrecks. … As no
                        man is good, but as he wishes the good of others, no man can be good in the
                        highest degree, who wishes not to others the largest measures of the
                        greatest good. … Knowledge always desires increase: it is like fire, which
                        must first be kindled by some external agent, but which will afterwards
                        propagate itself. … This speculation may, perhaps, be thought more subtle
                        than the grossness of real life will easily admit. Let it, however, be
                        remembered that the efficacy of ignorance has been long tried, and has not
                        produced the consequence expected. Let knowledge, therefore, take its turn;
                        and let the patrons of privation stand a while aside, and admit the

                        8. He insists upon it that there is no class of society which may not be
                        made to understand and appreciate the evidence that good government is good
                        government—that all classes ought to be thoroughly instructed in politics.
                        “I would add, however, that verbal instructions did not suffice; that it was
                        necessary to have doctrinal books, suited to the purpose, and in every
                        body’s hand. This help was so much the more important, as it was clear of
                        all inconvenience, for error cannot stand the presence of evidence; and
                        contradication, is not less advantageous to evidence, than it is fatal to
                        error, which has nothing to fear so much as examination.” [F] t. ii, p. 91,
                        Ed. a Londres 1768. See t. I, p. 294 for a good thought—that under a bad
                        government there is no common interest—every man is governed by his private.

                    <p>“We can say with truth that in the order of human things, the true teacher of
                        the moral man is the public system of government. <emph>Regis ad exemplum

                        sole force of example that that great truth is established, it is moreover
                        on the first principles which determine our moral character and our wills.
                        Whatever are, in a nation, the routes to high positions, to honours, to
                        public consideration, be certain that the desire to enjoy these honours will
                        lead us to take those routes. Wherever riches are the measure of public
                        consideration; wherever gold is publicly flattered as a God and more
                        honoured than virtue; wherever, at last, it becomes the germ of the most
                        piquant pleasures, the most proper to put our motives in action, it becomes
                        necessary that men are avid for gold, that they sacrifice everything for

                        the best, but most neglected part of morality; 2. the means of repairing the
                        consequences of our faults,—an important part of morality the more
                        neglected, because in almost every country, the avarice and ambition of
                        priests have endeavoured to substitute for this duty vain and absurd

                        necessary; and in other states, they are still more seldom productive of any

                        have not been practised generally by any nation. They are incompatible with

                        to search for them among the savage and superstitious nations which have
                        succeeded the Romans, or among the enslaved nations of Asia. They are still
                        rare among ourselves; who have added the corruption arising from a
                        mercantile spirit, to the disgraceful remains of the prejudices of our

                        flattered, instead of suppressing, the vices of humanity. It is because
                        laws, always dictated by the feelings of the powerful, have ever consecrated
                        the tyranny of power—the tyranny of husbands over wives, of fathers over

                        over the little, or of the populace over the citizens. Faithful interpreters
                        of vanity, laws have directed men into ranks and classes; in defiance of
                        nature, which labours to unite them: Every where they have bent their aid to
                        imposture and monopoly; of which the tendency is to stifle honest and
                        unprotected industry: Every where the penal laws have violated the rights of

                        taxation, and of the executive power have violated the rights of liberty:
                        Every where, the complication of the laws, as well as their unjust
                        provisions, have tended to excite fraud; and, by setting up opposite
                        interests, to make men enemies of one another: They have every where
                        encouraged the great inequality of fortunes, which plunges a small part of

                            them. No matter how shocking any folly dogmatically asserted may be, it
                            is swallowed without effort. … There is no opening to reclaim such men:
                            determined not to see, they avert their eyes; and when the object is
                            again presented, they had rather lose their sight than question their
                            belief. Were this otherwise, should we, could we be told, that such or
                            such a thing is a miracle, and proves a divine original, when reported
                            miracles are common to a thousand prophets, and a thousand impostors? …
                            {E} very one can work miracles, every fool can collect fools, and
                            produce witnesses to testify for him. … Wesley relates his own power in
                            exorcism; and shall any of the gang pretend to less? … ‘{I} n doubtful

                    <p>This section is untitled. It is referred to as <emph>Popular Errors</emph> on

                            <emph>Fallacies</emph>, and a reference given to <ref

                            <ref target="cpb3ch4scrap139v">139v</ref>, near the beginning of
                            <emph>Popular Errors</emph>, a further reference is made to
                            <emph>Fallacies</emph> (though he may have been referring to the
                        material in <emph>CPB</emph> II as the remark is not item specific—if it is
                        a further reference to Aristotle, the most likely cross-reference is to
                        139v).</p>
                    <p>This section has been distinguished from <ref target="cpb3ch5">§ 5</ref>, not
                        on the grounds that the subject matter of this is chronologically
                        distinguishable from that of § 5 (though it is possibly a <emph>bit</emph>
                        later in origin), but rather because the topics included are more general
                        (though there is some overlapping of content), and the material on fallacies
                        in <emph>CPB</emph> II, suggests that the Baconian distinction of idols of
                        the tribe, cave, market place and theatre, were quite well known to him.
                        Mill’s admiration for Bacon radiates throughout these notebooks despite his
                        aversion to Bacon’s corrupt practices as an official of the crown. The
                        distinction made between the two sections is thus fairly clear:
                            <emph>Fallacies</emph> refers to those mistakes in reasoning which
                        affect the learned and many of the participants in the political system of
                        the day; <emph>Popular Errors</emph> analyses the type of errors that affect
                        the public at large. Note that, in <emph>CPB</emph> V, this exact
                        distinction is maintained by Mill in his scrap lists of quotations (see §§
                            <ref target="cpb5ch10">10</ref> and <ref target="cpb5ch11">11</ref>,
                        also <ref target="cpb5ch3">3</ref> and <ref target="cpb5ch4">4</ref>).
                        Further, at <ref target="cpb3ch4scrap113r">113r</ref>, there is the remark
                        that an item has been put in <emph>Popular Errors</emph> by mistake which
                        “should have been here.”</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the material in both sections quite clearly relates to the
                        subject matter of Bentham’s <emph>The Book of Fallacies</emph>, which
                        appeared in 1824, translated by Peregrine Bingham from the French of Etienne
                        Dumont’s edition which was based on Bentham’s manuscripts.

                            1816.</note> Bentham’s original manuscripts date from 1810 (Boxes
                        ciii-cv in the University College Collection), and an inspection of them
                        reveals a variety of hands in the margins. Some of these notes may be by
                        Mill whose work for Bentham continued up to the early 1820s. Unfortunately,
                        the Bentham project has never been able to afford a forensic graphologist to
                        distinguish the various hands in the Bentham papers, and it would be
                        extremely risky to positively identify any notes as Mill’s. The interested
                        reader might compare, however, this skeleton of an outline of a work on
                        fallacies, with the one that appeared in 1824, or, as amended, by the
                        addition of the anarchical fallacies from the Bentham manuscripts, in the
                        edition which appeared in Bentham’s <emph>Collected Works</emph>, volume II,
                        of the early 1840s.</p>

                    <p>“Surely, the belief of nations, the testimony of ages; and the authority of
                        fifteen centuries, are the strongest prejudices which can possibly be
                        conceived, in favour of any controverted facts, and no contradiction can be
                        offered to them, but under all the disadvantage and inequality, which any
                        influence of that sort can create. If our Observator therefore had really
                        desired, to have this question fairly examined, it should have been his
                        first care, to remove these capital prejudices out of the way, or at least
                        to moderate the force of them, by informing his readers, that if the
                        practice and example of past ages, of what duration soever, had been thought
                        of weight enough to over-rule all other evidence; no improvement of science,
                        or reformation in religion, nor even Christianity itself could ever have
                        made its way into the world.” Conyers Middleton’s <emph>Works</emph>, v. I,

                        every one who would arrive at truth. There is something exceedingly noble
                        and heartening in the tone of Bacon’s <emph>Magna Instauration</emph>, in
                        the manliness which he commends, the independence of mind, the thinking for
                        oneself, the freedom of the trammels of antecessors, the calling no man
                        master, the following the light of reason, the not putting out one’s own
                        eyes, to use dead men’s eyes. It is remarkable that all the men whose minds
                        in the field of morals and legislation have benefited their species, have

                        may say, with reluctance abandoned this unhappy man. He prevailed at length;
                        and to complete his blindness, mistook Jesus Christ’s abandonment of him,

                        of association with celestial intelligences; but as the excellence of every

                    <p>1. We are not, possibly, perfect judges of our own state. It is a
                        gratification of personal vanity to praise our country. The Turks think
                        themselves the happiest nation upon earth. I see not why a friend of
                        Bonaparte’s government might not use this argument —“vast approach to
                        goodness—a fine spectacle the French empire—See its power—see the happiness
                        of the people!”—<emph>Vide</emph> a most apt quotation from Herodotus,

                            each, after examination made, would place its own first; so well is each
                            persuaded that its own are by far the best.”</note></p>
                    <p>2. If it were held valid, it would from the lowest stage of society to the
                        highest be a complete bar to improvement.</p>
                    <p>3. But we are the happiest nation—True, but is that a reason why we should be
                        no happier? The maxim then is—as long as any nation is before you, you ought
                        to improve—when no one is before you, you ought to resist improvement. Then
                        it is a great misfortune to be the foremost. But being the foremost, we
                        ought to sit still, till some one gets before us—then we may move again. The
                        goodness or the badness of improving depends not upon the thing itself,
                        [but] upon the extraneous fact, of some other nation being or not being
                        before us.</p>
                    <p>4. Having much, we risk much to gain more.—Having much, and not taking care
                        to preserve, you may before you are aware come to lose all. I cannot enter
                        into the minds of those who see every thing to dread on the side of liberty,
                        nothing on the side of <del>government</del> despotism. Why is there nothing
                        to dread on the side of liberty? The intelligence of the people—That
                        intelligence is an equal security against the evils of democracy.</p>
                    <p>5. The more good a thing is, the more is it reasonable _wise, useful_ to risk
                        for the improvement of it. To take the contrary doctrine would be to say,
                        that efforts may be made to benefit the lot of humanity in all trifling
                        concernments—in all important ones, it ought ever to remain unimproved.</p>
                    <p>6. The argument here is, that one good step is a reason why you should never
                        make another: a strange reasoning. Once do good, a reason why you should
                        never do more. <note>As points 5 and 6 are in a cramped hand, and as 6

                        mere illusion to imagine, an opinion which passes from Generation to
                        Generation, may not be false. If we inquire ever so little into the Causes

                        Notions, which are agreeable to the first Prejudices of Youth, or the
                        Passions of the Heart, as the pretended Rules of Conjecture are. I desire no
                        more. This suffices to render these Opinions eternal, because none, except a
                        few Philosophical Minds, ever dream of examining whether what they see
                        allow’d on all hands be true or no. This every one supposes done long since,
                        and that the Ancients have clear’d the Coast of all Error; and therefore
                        delivers in his Turn to Posterity as infallible. … The Author of the

                        which are obvious and easily perceiv’d; whereas the intrinsick and essential
                        Reasons distinguishing Truth, are very difficultly trac’d. So that as Men
                        naturally study their Base, they almost always veer to that Side on which
                        they discover these external Marks. Now you know, Sir, Antiquity and

                    <p><emph>Practical Men</emph>—those who plume themselves upon that appellation,
                        Bacon describes as “skilled in <hi rend="underline">persons</hi> only, not
                            <hi rend="underline">matters</hi>;” by persons meaning the habits,

                        C—and not the qualities of men in the mass; not the general principles of
                        human nature; not the qualities on which men agree, but those in which they
                        differ. The latter knowledge is got chiefly from books and from
                        meditation—the former from familiarity with the individuals. “The practical
                        men,” Bacon says, “are not capable of the real part of business.—Such men
                        are fitter for <hi rend="underline">practice</hi> than for <hi
                            rend="underline">counsel</hi>; and they are good but in their own alley.
                        Turn them to new men, and they have lost their aim. … They are <hi

                        their shop are not very costly—Bacon’s <emph>Essay</emph> of Cunning XXIII
                            [<emph>sic</emph>]. Theassumptions of practical men are just as if
                        thieves should say, to the judge or legislature, you cannot decide about
                        thieves, because you have no practice in thieving—the sailor, you cannot
                        decide about navigation, because you are unpracticed in seamanship, etc.

                        examination have been found not to be true.—What hath been always supposed
                        is fit only for your lordships great reading to declare. But such arguments,

                        what has always been supposed—especially in those questions that concern
                        truths which are to be known from the nature of things. Because, I think,

                        you, and such my preparation which I brought with me to the reading of your
                        book. Would you know, now, what the event was? What effect was wrought in me
                        by the perusal and consideration of it?—To deal truly and ingenuously with
                        you, I fell somewhat in my good opinion both of your sufficiency and
                        sincerity: but was exceedingly confirmed in my ill opinion of the cause
                        maintained by you. I found every where snares that might entrap, and colours
                        that might deceive the simple; but nothing that might persuade, and very
                        little that might move, an understanding man, and one that can discern
                        between discourse and sophistry. In short, I was verily persuaded, that I
                        plainly saw, and could make it appear to all dispassionate and unprejudicate
                        judges, that a vein of sophistry and calumny did run clear through it, from
                        the beginning to the end.” Chillingworth, <emph>Rel. of Prot.</emph>, Pref.

                        be a way of settling a question, there is no difficulty. Every body can
                        settle every question. The meanest understanding in the world is on a level
                        with the most exalted, or rather in this line possessed of a decided
                        advantage, the one having a natural propensity, the other a natural
                        repugnance. The following remonstrance of Locke may occasionally have its
                        use. “I have been pretty large in making this matter plain, that they who
                        are so fond to bestow hard censures or names on the opinions of those who
                        differ from them, may consider sometimes whether they are not more due to
                        their own: and that they may be persuaded a little to temper that heat,
                        which, supposing the truth in their current opinions, gives them (as they
                        think) a right to lay what imputations they please on those who would fairly
                        examine the grounds they stand upon. For talking with a supposition and
                        insinuations, that truth and knowledge, nay, and religion too, stands and
                        falls with their systems, is at best but an imperious way of begging the
                        question, and assuming to themselves, under the pretence of zeal for the
                        cause of God, a title to infallibility. It is very becoming that men’s zeal
                        for truth should go as far as their proofs, but not go for proofs
                        themselves. He that attacks received opinions with any thing but fair
                        arguments, may, I own, be justly suspected not to mean well, nor to be led
                        by the love of truth; but the same may be said of him too who defends them.
                        An error is not the better for being common, nor truth the worse for having
                        lain neglected.” Locke’s <emph>Second Reply to the Bishop of Worcester,
                            Works</emph>, 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>, iv, 466—“I pretend not to inquire
                        what measures of zeal, nor for what, guides your lordship’s pen in such a
                        way of writing” (using means to discredit a book, extraneous to the
                        refutation of its arguments), “as yours has, all along been with me; only I
                        cannot but consider what refutation it would give to the writings of the
                        fathers of the church, if they should think truth required, or religion
                        allowed them to imitate such patterns. But God be thanked there be those
                        amongst them who do not admire such ways of managing the cause of truth or
                        religion; they being sensible that if every one, who believes, or can
                        pretend he has truth on his side, is thereby authorized without proof to
                        insinuate whatever may serve to prejudice men’s minds against the other

                    <p>To find fault with novelty, is to find fault with thought. To blame a man for
                        not thinking as other people have thought, is very possibly blaming him for
                        being in the right. Why should it be a virtue to think only as our
                        predecessors have thought before us? Had they any other faculties to think
                        with than we have? Why should they be able to think for us, than we for
                        ourselves? Let us lay it down as a rule, to be carried through all things,
                        that we are to think only as those who have gone before us have thought; we
                        renounce the use of our minds; we substitute their minds to our own. As good
                        be without minds. Again are we to take all the opinions of our predecessors,
                        or take some, reject others? If the latter, how are we to chuse? Are we to
                        be decided by evidence? If so, we no longer take the opinion simply because
                        it was held by another; we take it because it stands upon evidence, and then
                        it is our own opinion, whether it was <del>or was not held by any previous
                            inquirer</del> ever held by any body previously, or not.</p>
                    <p>To attempt to make any <del>body</del> mind believe any thing, except upon
                        evidence, and as far as that mind sees the force of that evidence, what is
                        it? It is to attempt to make men believe, only because other people believe,
                        or profess to believe. It is to make their minds slaves. But to believe,
                        because other people believe, is a very unsure ground. How do I know that
                        they are right? If I see evidence, then I know. Men are often led to embrace
                        opinions without evidence; embracing therefore proves not truth. After all
                        why <del>live upon borrowed</del> borrow opinions? <del>begged or
                            borrowed</del>? What motive can there be for that? Why <del>live upon

                        opinions, when the mind may work, and earn its own subsistence? He who takes
                        opinions upon trust, cannot so much as pretend to be guided by the love of
                        truth. He may have motives of whatever other sort he pleases: this decidedly
                        is not the ground of his choice.</p>

                        should not, like sheep, follow the lead of the throng in front of us,
                        travelling, thus, the way that all go and not the way we ought to go. Yet
                        nothing involves us in greater trouble than the fact that we adapt ourselves
                        to common report in the belief that the best things are those that have met
                        with great approval,—the fact that, having so many to follow, we live after
                        the rule, not of reason, but of imitation. The result of this is that people
                        are piled high, one above another, as they rush to destruction. And just as
                        it happens that in a great crush of humanity, when the people push against
                        each other, no one can fall down without drawing along another, and those
                        that are in front cause destruction to those behind—this same thing you may
                        see happening everywhere in life. No man can go wrong to his own hurt only,
                        but he will be both the cause and the sponsor of another’s wrongdoing. For
                        it is dangerous to attach one’s self to the crowd in front, and so long as
                        each one of us is more willing to trust another than to judge for himself,
                        we never show any judgement in the matter of living, but always a blind
                        trust, and a mistake that has been passed on from hand to hand finally
                        involves us and works our destruction. It is the example of other people
                        that is our undoing; let us merely separate ourselves from the crowd, and we

                        in a proposition. The nature of this consists, in taking one proposition,
                        and having proved something with regard to that proposition, covertly taking
                        out that proposition, and putting another in its place. Example, the Jesuit
                        in Chillingworth, (Ans. to Pref., § 12.) states, that it is impious to
                        disbelieve any thing known to be testified by God. Presently he takes out
                        the term “disbelieves <hi rend="underline">any thing known to be
                            testified</hi> by God” and substitutes for it, the term “disbelieves <hi
                            rend="underline">any thing testified</hi> by God:” which use so far from
                        being the same, that they are, to the point in question, opposite. To
                        disbelieve any thing <hi rend="underline">known</hi> to be testified by God,
                        is only not impious, because it is impossible: it would be to believe it and
                        not believe it at the same time. To disbelieve a thing testified by God, but
                        not known to be testified, may be not only not impious, but an imperious
                        duty. <note>Chillingworth, <emph>Religion of Protestants</emph>, pp. 11-12,

                    <p><emph>Motive to the Use of Fallacies.</emph> How few men are there who have
                        not some thing; several things; dearer to them than truth? Some, money—some,
                        power—some, vanity—some, their family—some, their party, etc. Now when a man
                        has any thing which is dearer to him than truth, what is the course which he
                        will pursue? As often as truth is against that object, he will be against
                        truth. So far is clear. When a man is against truth, what does he do? His
                        great object is to make it appear not to be truth. <del>If he conveniently
                            can</del> He will make himself believe that it is not truth, as much as
                        he can; and at any rate will use every possible endeavour to make others.
                        The motives he has to make others believe that not to be truth which is
                        against the object which he holds dearer than truth, is obvious. That which
                        he has to make himself believe it not to be truth, is rather more difficult
                        to perceive. But this at any rate is plain, that every man likes to stand
                        well with himself; does not like to think himself a rascal, but as little as
                        he can help. Now to know that any thing is true, and yet that he is opposing
                        it, forces a man to think himself a rascal. He therefore tries as much as he
                        can to keep himself from knowing any thing which is contrary to the object
                        dearer than truth, is of that sacred character. From the same source, he
                        derives a motive to hate all those who are for the universal discovery and
                        display of truth. For they are apt to discover what he wishes to conceal.
                        Secondly, they present to him a humbling, and therefore hateful
                        contrast.—The purveyors of sophisms for the use of power.</p>

                        “These ‘gentlemen’ of the world, whose maxims very much resemble those of
                        knaves; these men, so yielding, so moderate, who always find that all goes
                        well because they have an interest in seeing that nothing works better.” [F]
                        Rousseau, <emph>Lett. a d’Alembert sur les Spectac.</emph>, quoted by
                        Dumont, <emph>Sophismes</emph> de Bentham, p. 102. With respect to
                        improvement, and the propriety or impropriety of reform, the question is not
                        whether the state to be reformed <del>as</del> is <del>worse in any
                            degree</del> more good, or whether it is less good; <del>I am Let
                            the</del> but whether the proposed attempt to reform offers a
                            <del>chance</del> greater chance for good or for evil. Let the state be
                        one of the worst of states, any proposal to improve it which offers a
                        greater chance of evil than of good ought to be resisted; let the state be
                        one of the best every attempt to improve it which offers a greater chance of
                        good than of evil ought clearly to be <del>end? appr erecte</del> approved.
                        The state, then, has nothing to do with the question of improvement, which
                        is this and this alone, whether the proposed attempt promises greater good
                        or evil; a question equally applicable to all states.—To make out of present
                        excellence an argument against the pursuit of excellence, <del>is a new
                            display of ingenuity</del> out of goodness an argument against goodness,
                        is a new resource.—Again, goodness is a comparative term—Good, as compared
                        with worse? that may be said of any thing.—Good, as compared with better?
                        that is nonsense. Good, it will be said, as compared with any thing that
                        exists. But what is that to the purpose? Is man not to be allowed to
                        improve? Is it not the distinction of his nature that he is a progressive
                        being? Is it absurd to presume that society will make any advances from the
                        stage in which it is now found? Is it absurd not to conclude that society
                        has now attained its highest perfection? If the very contrary of all this
                        would be absurd, may not a time come when society will <del>be as far
                            advanced above what it now is, as what it now is the present state is
                            superior to that of</del> look down as far upon the present state of
                        improvement, as we of the present day look down upon the times of William
                        the Conqueror? If a man, in the time of William the Conqueror had opposed
                        any of the acts by which society was benefited, on the argument that things
                        were good as they were, should we not look back upon that man with a sort of
                        pity? When an equal degree of improvement is made beyond the present stage,
                        must not the men of that future time look back upon the men who hold that
                        language in the present with sentiments of the same description?—If society
                        has heretofore made great advancement, that, instead of an argument against
                        future exertion, is the strongest argument in favour of it: for, if
                        heretofore the race had struggled after improvement in vain, remaining fixed
                        in the original unhappy, ignorant, and brutal situation, there would have

                    <p>future exertions would have amended their deplorable circumstances. But if on
                        the other hand, the previous exertions toward improvement have been attended

                        effects with a rapidity heretofore unknown.—Make a general rule, that when
                        any body is pleased to call the situation of any thing good, a rule
                        applicable to human affairs throughout, in that case, all improvement is to
                        be resisted, in knowledge, in wealth, in population, in every thing; where
                        you have several good roads, make no more; several good physicians admit no
                        more; several good machines, admit no more, several good manufactures, admit
                        no more; several wealthy men, admit no more; several good books, admit no
                        more—if this is a rule, sanctioned by the common reason, and common practice
                        of mankind, give it your adoption—if, on the contrary, it is
                            <del>exploded</del> renounced and exploded by the common reason and
                        common practice of mankind, by what argument can you persuade me to trust to

                        gifted with good sense, can pretend that a change in manners and opinion
                        ought not to be productive of a corresponding change in our institutions?
                        Must government then always be three hundred years in arrears? … No, it will
                        be said, there are things which ought to be changed, but the government
                        ought to be immutable. There could not be a more effectual way of reducing
                        revolutions to a system; for if the government of a country refuses to
                        participate in any degree in the progressive advance of men and things, it
                        will necessarily be overthrown by them. Can men coolly discuss whether the
                        form of the governments of the present time ought to be in correspondence
                        with the wants of the existing generation, or of those which are no more?
                        Whether it is in the dark and disputed antiquity of history that a statesman
                        ought to look for his rule of conduct; or whether that statesman [should
                        possess the talents and firmness of a Pitt,] should know where power
                        resides, whither opinion tends, and where he can take his stand to act on
                        the national feeling? For without the nation, nothing is to be done—with it,
                        every thing, except that which would tend to degrade it: bayonets are the

                        have opposed him in his opinions, desires, or interests or for whom he has
                        conceived an aversion? Such aversion or opposition is enough in his eyes to
                        transform a person overnight into an unfaithful fool, proud, ignorant,
                        without conscience or honour. In his affections and desires a man is no more
                        moderate or just than in his hates: Whomever he loves is without fault;
                        whatever he desires, right and obtainable; whatever he does not want, unjust
                        and impossible. The very passion which possesses him is the only reason he
                        can give for these judgments. In his heart he implicitly invokes this sort
                        of reasoning: I love him. Therefore, he is the cleverest man in the world. I
                        hate him. Therefore, he is a nobody.” [F] <emph>Ib.</emph>, 394, 5.

                    <p>Self-conceited people lay it down as their first principle, that whatsoever
                        they think is right. Of course every opinion contrary to theirs is wrong.
                        “In the high opinion he has of his own insight lies the fault of such a
                        person who regards his own thought as clear and evident and believes the
                        whole world must accept these views once announced. Consequently, such a man
                        rarely troubles himself to furnish proofs and seldom listens to the views of
                        others. Since he regards his holding of an opinion as a reason for accepting
                        that opinion, he wants everyone else to yield to this authority.” 395. [F]

                        self-love at least makes him persist in these errors. Such determination to
                        defend an opinion induces man to regard not whether the reasons he advances
                        are true or false but rather to evaluate them as serving or not serving to

                        aspects which are deemed more likely to accompany truth than falsity. … The
                        main external signs of truth are taken to be: (a) the authority of a
                        proponent and (b) the manner of propounding. These external signs are potent
                        persuaders and overwhelm nearly every mind.” [F] Passing by what is said on

                            manner.</emph> “More misleading than the sophisms of authority are the
                        sophisms of manner: When a man speaks with grace, facility, gravity,
                        moderation, or gentleness, we naturally believe he is right; but if he
                        speaks obnoxiously or displays any passion, acrimony, or presumption in his
                        actions or his words, we believe him in the wrong. But if so we judge, then
                        often are we deceived. Some men mouth stupidities gravely and modestly;
                        others of quick temper or even under the influence of some passion, which
                        shows in face or words, have truths on their tongues. Some very mediocre and
                        superficial men, nurtured at court where the art of pleasing is most studied
                        and practised, use their very agreeable manners to render judgments
                        acceptable. In others an unimposing exterior may house a sturdy mind within.
                        Some speak better than they think, while others think better than they
                        speak. … The two aspects of discourse, matter and manner, must be considered
                        separately. The manner must be judged by the manner; the matter, by the
                        matter; and not the matter by the manner nor the manner by the matter.” 433,

                        Extrinsic Reasons.] The latter have little or no place, in honest
                        enlightened enquiry. A thing is to be judged of by what it is in itself, not
                        by what other things are, on which the nature of it does not depend. “As far
                        as philosophical method is concerned, it makes no difference whether a truth
                        has been known for a long time or has been just recently discovered, or
                        whether a truth is valued or condemned at the moment, or whether it was
                        discovered by others or independently by oneself, or whether it is defended
                        by a famous author or lies hidden in the work of an obscure author. For the
                        philosopher loves the truth for its own sake. He does not not subordinate
                        truth to fame, or to power, or to the favor of others. [He does not seek the
                        goods of fortune at the expense of truth.] For otherwise he who would
                        develop philosophy according to the philosophical method would accept what
                        is false as true, and what is doubtful as certain, in order to cultivate the
                        favor of others, or in order to become famous, or in order to offer the
                        careless reader an acceptable fare. And when he uses antecedents to prove
                        consequents, he will use erroneous and uncertain principles to prove
                        erroneous and uncertain conclusions. Thus he will continually multiply error
                        for his own gain, and will lead others into error. And what he teaches will
                        not be properly interrelated. However, what is not understood should be
                        renounced by philosophical method.” [L] Wolfii, <emph>Log.</emph>, Dic.

                        produce. … And surely he cannot be thought to have produced any formidable
                        argument against the inquiry, who has advanced little more than that it is
                        impossible to be performed.—Impossibility is a formidable sound to ignorance

                        <emph>Moderation.</emph> Various fallacies are often wrapt up in this term.
                        It is a word sometimes applied to good things, sometimes to bad things. When
                        it is applied to bad things, the endeavour is to get credit to the bad
                        things, by aid of a word, which being often applied to good things carries
                        along with it the credit which the good things really deserve. There are
                        certain qualities the exercise of which is always, and in all circumstances
                        good; of these I reckon wisdom, virtue, <del>happiness</del> there are other
                            <del>things which are</del> qualities the exercise of which is sometimes
                        good, sometimes bad, according to the cases to which they are applied, one
                        of these is cheerfulness, which though generally good, would be inhuman in
                        the presence of a man who had just sustained some overwhelming calamity. Now
                        is moderation, in your opinion, belonging to the first of these classes, or
                        to the second? If you reply to the first, then what will you say to the
                        following cases? Do you think it proper to be moderate in paying your debts?
                        To be moderate in speaking the truth? To be moderate in your fidelity? Or
                        would you not wish for yourself, and all the human race, that they should
                        never rest till they carry these qualities to the greatest possible height?
                        But what are all these but so many cases of the one great general rule, to
                        do to your fellow creatures all the good that is in your power? Do you think
                        it is <del>not blameable not</del> right to be moderate in doing good, that
                        is, to take care that you shall not do all the good in your power, but a
                        good deal less? I know you too well, to suppose you would not regret such a
                        rule. But if within the bounds of our power there ought to be no limits,
                        that is no moderation, in our doing good, the only question in politics is,
                        what will do good, for as soon as you have ascertained that, you ought to do
                        every [thing] which is in your power to attain it.</p>

                        [In order to profit from a desirable state must one neglect a better? Does
                        not one lose all the time that could be better employed?] If we are happy
                        now, let us enjoy, and let us improve our happiness. When people have made a
                        certain progress in good, and are in more favourable circumstances than we
                        for advancing, ought they to stand still? then when they have the greatest
                        encouragement to advance? This would be pusillanimity indeed! Whatever be
                        the state in which men are placed, one very high in happiness, or one very
                        low; <del>an equal</del> a new portion of happiness added to the high is as
                        great a good, if equal in quantity, as a new portion added to the low; and
                        the man who contributes to prevent the new acquisition of happiness is as
                        great an enemy of mankind in the one case as in the other. If <del>we
                            are</del> men are happy now, in comparison of the men 300 years ago: the
                        men of 300 years ago were happy compared with our savage ancestors naked in
                        the woods. If it is a good argument to make us resist improvement now, it
                        would have been a good argument to make them resist improvement then, and
                        deprive us of all the happiness by which our present state is happier than
                        theirs. If we successfully resist improvement now, the effect would be to
                        deprive posterity of a still greater portion of happiness, in as much as
                        society is now in a condition to advance much faster than it was 300 years
                        ago. <note>The quotation has not been precisely identified, it may be from

                        our deliberations can receive very little assistance from merriment and
                        ridicule; and that truth is seldom discovered by those who are chiefly
                        solicitous to start a jest. To convince the understanding, and to tickle the
                        fancy, are purposes very different, and must be promoted by different means;
                        nor is he always to imagine himself superior in the dispute, who is
                        applauded with the loudest laugh.—To laugh, my lords, and to endeavour to
                        communicate the same mirth to others, when great affairs are to be
                        considered, is certainly to neglect the end for which we are assembled, and
                        the reasons for which the privilege of debating was originally granted us.
                        For doubtless, my lords, our honours and our power were not conferred upon
                        us, that we might be merry with the better grace, or that we might meet at
                        certain times to divert ourselves with turning the great affairs of the
                        nation to ridicule.—But, my lords, still less defensible is this practice,

                        subject. Wit and humour I enjoy, as much as any one. They are no mean
                        sources of our pleasures, and as such are to be esteemed and cultivated.
                        But, Sir, when they are made use of, not as means to a legitimate pleasure,
                        but as a means to another end, with which they are by nature wholly
                        disconnected, then, Sir, the avenue of mischief is entered, and I oppose
                        myself, to the[ir] progress. A joke, Sir, is no evidence; it is a thing of a
                        different nature. Whensoever, therefore, in the determination of any great
                        question, a joke is put into the scales of evidence, and made to weigh for a
                        single grain, there deception, Sir, is created, and the man who thus
                        endeavours to create it, is a cheat and impostor.—Having, then, Sir,
                        diverted ourselves enough, having enjoyed our pastime, fully as long as
                        appears to be convenient, we will now, if you please, proceed to business.
                        Having indulged sufficiently in relaxation, we will now begin to think and
                        to study. As we have a certain affair of importance, upon which we are to
                        hear evidence, and then to decide, I think we should now proceed to the
                        business of taking that evidence. Now, Sir, the taking of evidence is a
                        solemn, judicial procedure, and should be performed with a mind properly
                        attuned to its nature. <del>Unhappily</del> Hardly any tone of mind is less
                        adapted to the solemn, judicial business of taking and appreciating
                        evidence, than that of jesting and laughter. Laughter is a state of mind
                        which imports the dissipation of attention. The judging upon evidence, the
                        concentration of it. Evidence <del>is drawn</del> turns upon the merits of
                        the question; a joke turns upon remote allusions. Evidence is drawn from the
                        essence, the inmost qualities; a joke <del>is drawn</del> from the outward
                        accidents. The <del>mind which has contracted a</del> habit of looking out
                        for the circumstances on which a joke turns; is totally different from the
                        habit of looking out for evidence. See Bacon’s Commentary, on the proverb of
                        Solomon, “Scornful men bring a city into a snare.” <note><emph>Advancement

                        knowledge with ignorance: since, if scurrility and merriment are to
                        determine us, it is not necessary either to be honest or wise to obtain the
                        superiority in any debate: it will only be necessary to rail and to laugh,
                        which one man may generally perform with as much success as another.”

                        <emph>Codex Sophismatum.</emph> In the fifth chapter of Sterne’s posthumous
                            <emph>Works</emph>, he informs us that he was employed to write a
                        political pamphlet in defence of Sir Robert Walpole, and that he took the
                        following method.—“I affirmed that the high price of provisions, so loudly
                        complained of, arose from the riches and affluence daily flowing into the
                        kingdom, under the auspices of our minister. And that the accumulation of
                        taxes, like the rising of rents, was the surest token of a nations thriving;
                        that the dearness of markets, with the new imposts of government,
                        necessarily doubled industry; and that an exercise <hi rend="underline">of
                            this natural kind of manufacture</hi>, was adding to the capital stock
                        of the commonwealth. I lamented the fatal effects to be apprehended from all
                        these heats, animosities, and revilings, which I said, <hi rend="underline"
                            >I had good reason</hi> to affirm, were but a method of acting and
                        instilling treason under cover; for that whenever the minister was abused,
                            <hi rend="underline">the king was attacked</hi>.—This book of mine has
                        been the codex, or <emph>ars politica</emph>, of all the ministerial
                        sycophants, ever since that era; for I have scarcely met with a paragraph in
                        any of the state-hireling writers for many years past, that I could not
                        trace fairly back to my own code.” This quotation is made from Lieut. Hall,
                            <emph>Travels in Canada</emph>, etc.—Verify it. <note>Remaining
                            underlining in pencil, not ink, therefore probably added later.</note>
                        <hi rend="underline">The first of the rules</hi> here exemplified is,
                        whenever the existence of an evil cannot be denied, to <hi rend="underline"
                            >find out some cause for it</hi>, to which people are attached, and
                        praise the minister for the existence of the cause: High prices, that is low
                        means, are the effect of wealth; so is high taxation; expensive
                        establishments: a detestable and ruinous war has for its cause the national
                        glory, of which the minister has taken a miraculous [policy]. <hi
                            rend="underline">The next of the rules</hi> is, when the existence of an
                        evil cannot be denied, <hi rend="underline">to ascribe to it some
                            effects</hi>, which are regarded as very delightful: High taxes, and
                        high prices, encourage industry; <hi rend="underline">bad institutions, when
                            old, secure property</hi>. Corresponding to this is a rule, though not
                        exemplified in Sterne’s Codex, as often as any thing undeniably good is
                        proposed, to ascribe horrid effects to the introduction of it: When the cure
                        of the present oligarchical misrule is recommended by the introduction of a
                        really rational representation, to say that it would make <del>every thing
                            desirable</del> the glories of society be “trodden down under the hoofs
                        of a swinish multitude.” Sterne’s last rule is one, however, nearly allied
                        to the preceding; That, as often as any complaint is raised of any evil, the
                        complain[an]t should be uniformly accused of sedition and treason; for if
                        any thing is blamed, the king is attacked. <note>Hall, <emph>Travels in

                            (though he was a Whig) but from the forged <emph>Posthumous Works</emph>

                            down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude” comes from Burke’s

                        that every day adds to its establishment; and that falsehoods, however
                        specious, however supported by power, or established by confederacies, are
                        unable to stand before the stroke of time. Against the inconveniences and
                        vexations of long life, may be set the pleasure of discovering truth,
                        perhaps the only pleasure that age affords. Nor is it a slight satisfaction,
                        to a man not utterly infatuated, or depraved, to find opportunities of

                        public men is Jacobinism; it is murder and sodomy; and so on. Public men
                        cannot find breath to vent the indignation which labours within them upon
                        such a violation done to their moral frame. Yet philosophy says, “The desire
                        for pleasure and the aversion to pain are the common motives which belong to
                        our constitution, and which are the principles of all our movements. To wish
                        that man acts in a sense contrary to the force of these motives, is to
                        pretend to change the unalterable order of nature: it is to propose to
                        render effects independent of their causes, it is to undertake to make a
                        river rise to its source.” [F] Mercier de la Riviere, <emph>Ordre etc. des

                        fear contradiction, I maintain […] that in general the public interest is
                        not in safe hands when it is in opposition to the particular interests of
                        those to whom it is entrusted; that, on the contrary, it is evident that
                        then there is everything to fear from these same particular interests and of

                        but is a frequent source of erroneous persuasion. The following is a genuine
                        specimen of the impudence of the authors and defenders of abuses. M. des

                            Critique</emph>, etc., p. xxxv, says, speaking of the persecution of
                        protestants in France, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes: “They
                        had sent dragoons to the homes of the protestants, and the soldiers lived in
                        them as they pleased, committing all sorts of violence and disorders in
                        order to force the protestants to embrace the Roman religion. Some submitted
                        outwardly, others took refuge in foreign countries in order to serve God
                        according to the light of their conscience. However the converters did not
                        fail to deny strongly that they had done any violence to them; one could
                        hardly find two or three who would avow the lodging of soldiers, which the
                        protestants called the crusade of dragoons, the conversions by dragoonade. …

                        This notorious candidate for noisy fame has adopted a particular weapon of
                        defence. When any body charges him, face to face, with a crime which he
                        cannot deny, he points to his accuser and says, You are a sodomite. Thus
                        also, Statesmen, and Clergymen; charge them or their system with vices which
                        you can prove, and they take down a weapon out of Mr. Hunt’s armoury. They
                        call you Jacobin, or Atheist; just as he calls an accuser Sodomite, for the
                        same reason, and with the same honour. <note>Henry Hunt, 1773-1835, radical

                    <p><emph>Personalities, Hobgoblins, Authority, Ridicule</emph>: In the dispute
                        between Polus and Socrates in the <emph>Gorgias</emph>, Polus brings all
                        these forward against Socrates; and is finely rebuked. When Polus exclaims
                        instead of answering, and cries bad, wicked, foolish: Socrates says, you are
                        scolding, O Polus, not refuting; you are taking upon you the character of a
                        judge, and inflicting punishment before trial and without proof.—When Polus
                        says, But does not the opinion of all mankind refute you; who is of your
                        opinion? who is not of mine? Socrates answers, you reply to me, O Polus,
                        with rhetoric, not with logic: the rhetoricians in the forum produce
                        witnesses to prove what they affirm, and those who produce the greatest
                        number, are allowed to prevail; but <del>this is not a criterion of
                            truth</del> when truth is the question, this is not a criterion, for
                        often the greatest number of witnesses are against the truth: the virtue of
                        logic is to make the contending party himself confess the truth.—When Polus
                        strings together a number of supposed absurd, and wicked consequences;
                        Socrates says, <del>you are conjuring up ghosts to frighten me, and not
                            given reasons to refute me</del>. instead of bringing witnesses against
                        me, you are now bringing Ghosts: Ghosts are to serve as refutation.—When
                        Polus laughed; Socrates says, you laugh O Polus; is that another of your
                        modes of refuting; when any body states any thing, not to adduce evidence
                        against him, but only to laugh? See Platonis <emph>Opera</emph>, Biponti,

                            “The passion for the honour of a profession, like that for the grandeur
                            of our own country, is to be regulated, not extinguished. Every man,
                            from the highest to the lowest station, ought to warm his heart, and
                            animate his endeavours with the hopes of being useful to the world, by
                            advancing the art which it is his lot to exercise, and for that end he
                            must necessarily consider the whole extent of its application, and the
                            whole weight of its importance. But let him not too readily imagine that
                            another is ill-employed, because, for want of fuller knowledge of his
                            business, he is not able to comprehend its dignity. Every man ought to
                            endeavour at eminence, not by pulling others down, but by raising
                            himself, and enjoy the pleasure of his own superiority, whether
                            imaginary or real, without interrupting others in the same
                            felicity.”</note>

                        defend ancient rules they must necessarily be examined; and if received
                        opinions, on examination, be found true, we enjoy the advantage of believing
                        that from reason to which we had previously given our assent from habit; if
                        false, the world is then freed from an error.—It is no uncommon thing,
                        however, for men to be angry at those who obliged them to scrutinize what
                        had been admitted upon trust. The minds, which, like that of Montaigne,
                        quietly slumber on the pillow of scepticism, are not common; and still less
                        common are those who are tormented by the desire of discovering truth. The
                        vulgar love to believe without proof, and to cherish their security in blind
                        faith, as a thing necessary to their ease and safety.” [F] Condorcet,

                        enemy, he always puts on it the foulest. Catch the pretended colour, and
                        shew the corresponding colour, for which he has artfully substituted a false
                        one: that the man who has described himself as spirited, is brutal and
                        insolent; as mild, is tame and pusillanimous; as frugal, and modest, is
                        sordid and ungenerous; as governed by moderation, is not governed by
                        principle; as respecting the opinions of other men, is governed by fashion;
                        as going about prejudices, is fearing to attack them. Again, when a man
                        represents his enemy, as rash, he may be only magnanimous; as wild and
                        violent, he may be only shewing a mixture of wisdom and courage in defence
                        of what is best for mankind; as vain, he may be only <del>desirous</del>
                        alive to the good opinion of mankind; as proud, he may be only undisguised;
                        as rude, he may be only plain, and so on.—Fair names to foul deeds—and foul
                        names to any deeds of those we like not, is an old artifice. When therefore
                        any set of bad actions are likely to take place, we should always think what

                        colours with which it is likely the attempt will be made to cover them over.
                        When the intention is to rob the people of some of their liberties, the
                        security of Man is the false colour employed: When a new security for good
                        government is proposed, they who resist it work to cover it with the colour

                        in preventing inquiry, tries to make the inquiry unpopular by calling it
                            <emph>inquisition.</emph> Now what is meant by inquisition in this case?
                        Does he mean that sort of inquiry which is calculated to get at the truth?

                        doubt that it is the interest of good government. If he means by it an

                        our mistake, by giving us at once all that is necessary to ascertain the
                        truth, and shewing that it is so. The fallacy in this case consists in
                        availing oneself of the odium attached to a word, by its use on some
                        remarkable occasion which is odious, and trying to attach the same odium to
                        [a] case which is not odious, but in the highest degree meritorious. The
                        inquisition performed in the tribunal of that name, in Roman Catholic

                    <p><emph>Motives.</emph> Every thing applies to this fallacy, which is any where
                        found under the title <emph>Personalities.</emph> In all inquiries
                        respecting what any man has advanced, every thing is either absurd or
                        wicked, that has any other object than that of finding out the truth or
                        falsehood of what he has advanced. But the only thing that <del>has any
                            influence is entitled to</del> tends to prove the truth or falsehood of
                        any thing advanced is <hi rend="underline">evidence</hi>. Now, then, are the

                        truth or falsehood of what he speaks? It would be ridiculous to say so. Is
                        truth less truth, or more truth, because a man speaks it with a good or a
                        bad motive? It is just as absurd, therefore, to talk about a man’s <hi

                        evidence of what he affirms; as it would be to talk about the colour of his
                        hair, or the shape of his leg. No body, therefore, uses this talk, but
                        either because he is drivelling, and knows not what is conducive to his end;
                        or because he is wicked, and endeavouring to defeat inquiry by fraudulent
                        means.</p>
                    <p><emph>Addressing any of the Passions</emph>, as pride, anger, fear, is to be
                        regarded in the light of a fallacy. It is an attempt to mislead: to govern
                        by something other than reason.</p>
                    <p><emph>Experience.</emph> This term is very often applied as one of the
                        instruments of misrule. In that case it is always perverted. In that case,
                        it is always a supposed, but unreal experience, that is set up against a
                        real one.—It is applied in a way directly the reverse of that in which it is
                        applied in the <del>ordinary and regular</del> established and approved
                        wisdom <del>and prudence</del> of human life. There it is applied in the way
                        of <hi rend="underline">profiting</hi> by experience; of observing what is
                        amiss in the mode, or in the produce of action, and correcting both the one
                        and the other. <del>According to</del> The political defenders of wrong,
                            <del>you ought to observe what is amiss in past action, only for the
                            purpose</del> put you in mind of experience only to convince that you
                        ought not to correct what is wrong—that nothing so much imports you as to
                        keep wrong <del>what is wrong</del> as it is, and never allow it to be
                            <del>altered</del> made right.—This perversion of the word
                            <emph>experience</emph> is very often made in the way of setting up a
                        gross experience; something in the lump; complicated, and confused, to which
                        no precise ideas are annexed; in opposition to an experience analysed,
                        resolved into its constituent parts, well understood, clear, and distinct.
                        As the Empiric, the ignorant quack has a gross experience of the effects of
                        his nostrum, made up of various ingredients: he knows that it has
                            <del>cured</del> been attended with cure in some instances, with the
                        reverse in others; and he goes on applauding it; taking account of all the
                        cases of cure, omitting all the cases of failure. But if any body should
                        propose to him to alter the composition, to add or subtract any ingredients,
                        or substitute one for another, this he would vehemently oppose: and would
                        say, No, we have <hi rend="underline">experience</hi> of the medicine as it
                        is. We have no experience of it, as you would have it altered. Yet he may be

                    <p>…you say about experience is a mere perversion of the term. I inform you, if
                        you do not know, that there is not one of the ingredients of this nostrum of
                        yours, of which the most perfect experience is not attained, and of which
                        the effects are not accurately known. I can tell you with perfect assurance,
                        that the effect of such and such an ingredient is only to counteract the
                        effects of the rest; and that if you replace [it] by another, the effects
                        which you expect will more certainly arrive. In like manner, if the
                        ignorant, bigotted owner of some very imperfect machine, should be enamoured
                        of it, for the moderate portion of good effects which it produces; and
                        should tell the mechanist who recommended an improvement, that he was a
                        mischievous innovator, a Jacobin, for his machine was tried by experience;
                        all the world saw what admirable effects it had long produced: but his
                        novelty had nothing but theory to recommend it, which it would, therefore,
                        be the greatest folly in the world to adopt. Would not the mechanist inform
                        him, that the experience which he talked of was a gross, uninstructive
                        experience, that it took his machine in the lump, and therefore confusedly,
                        without enabling him to understand it: that there was another sort of
                        experience, of much more importance; an experience of the powers, one by
                        one, of which the agency of his machine consisted, and an experience of all
                        the various combinations, in which they were calculated to act: that by
                        means of this experience which gave a clear, and distinct knowledge, it was
                        easy to see, that there were in his machine certain powers which
                        counteracted the rest; and that if these were taken away, and others put in
                        their place, the good effects in which he now gloried, would be greatly
                        increased. And all this would be done, not without experience, or contrary
                        to experience, but all along, and in the most minute operation, under its
                        guidance. So, exactly, in government; when they tell us we have experience
                        of the machine in the lump, we tell them that this is a gross, and ignorant
                        experience, which yields no <del>sure and</del> salutary guidance; <del>It
                            is the experience, to the</del> no clear ideas; no lamp to the steps. It
                        is experience which accompanies analysis; to the very termination of its
                        progress; it is experience not of the gross lump, in its gross results, but
                        of the elementary powers of which it is composed, which is the really useful
                        experience—the experience which affords a masterly direction, which never
                        misleads.</p>
                    <p><emph>Mere Sounds</emph>—that these often produce the effects of fallacies,
                        is notorious. The tones of missionaries agitate the audience, when they
                        communicate hardly any ideas. The most decisive experiment is that of St.
                        Bernard, who preached the crusade among the German peasants, in the Latin
                        language. They knew not one word of his language, but were moved to rage and
                        transport by his preaching. The tones of Whitfield, and the tones of Pitt
                        account for much of the effects they produced. <note>The story of St.
                            Bernard (<emph>c.</emph> 1090-1153), preaching the Second Crusade of
                            1147-49, is from Gibbon, <emph>The Decline and Fall of the Roman
                                Empire</emph>, LIX: “The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less
                            easy conquest of the emperor Conrad: a phlegmatic people, ignorant of
                            his language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone and
                            gestures; and his progress, from Constance to Cologne, was the triumph
                            of eloquence and zeal.” Earlier he suggested that St. Bernard, had “as
                            much reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a
                            saint.” Other references are to George Whitefield (1714-70), leader of
                            the Calvinistic Methodists; and William Pitt (1708-78).</note></p>

                                <emph>Moral Essays</emph>: “Man is so far from knowing the truth
                            that he is even ignorant of its marks and characteristics. He often
                            forms to himself only confused ideas of the conditions of evidence and
                            certainty. And that is what makes him apply the rules by chance to every
                            vain glimmer that strikes him. Everything that pleases him becomes
                            evident. Thus after a heretic has consecrated his fantasies by the title
                            of certain truth which is clearly contained in the Scriptures he applies
                            to them, he afterwards stifles all the doubts which could be raised
                            against them, and he does not permit himself to regard them, or if he
                            regards them it is by considering them only as difficulties and he draws

                        worthy of esteem just in proportion as he throws off authority. The
                            <emph>Letter to the Hon. R. Peel, M. P. for the University of Oxford, on
                            the pernicious effects of a variable standard of value. By one of his
                            Constituents</emph>—ascribed to Mr. Copplestone, says, (p.1) “Sir, In
                        addressing to you these remarks upon the state of our currency, I have
                        presumed, partly on the political relation now subsisting between us, but
                        still more on the manliness and candour which your parliamentary conduct has
                        always exhibited, and which assures me that I shall obtain one reader at
                        least who will think for himself, and will not fear, upon a great practical
                        question, to declare what he thinks, however adverse his opinions may be to
                        those whose general line of politics he approves.” To “think for oneself” is
                        the very reverse of thinking by authority. He that follows authority does
                        not think for himself. He that thinks for himself does not follow authority.
                        Here it is represented as a prodigious virtue in Mr. Peel, that he rejects
                        all authority and will not be guided even by the opinion of his party.

                        measures for the extermination of the protestants, prefaced them with an
                        edict, affirming that he was actuated solely by a sense of justice; and had
                        no other object than to prevent one part of his subjects from infringing
                        upon the rights of another, and to deal out equal protection to catholic and
                        non-catholic. Another remarkable document, to the same purpose, is the
                        Remonstrance of the Archbishop of Sens to the same Louis, in which he sets
                        forth to his Sacred Majesty, that his mother; the wife of the living God;
                        was suffering under the greatest oppression; and after having groaned a long
                        while in the heart of her prelates who are her fathers, and in that of the
                        faithful who are her children, could no longer restrain her lamentations,

                        <emph>Order.</emph> It seems, Sir, from what you have said, almost all
                        directed to the praise of order; to shew how necessary it is to maintain
                        order; how necessary it is to avoid every thing which would disturb order,
                        that you are a great lover of order, and so am I. So in truth is every body
                        whom I have ever met with in the whole course of my life. Every body likes
                        that order, which is favourable to himself, praises that order, and hates
                        and dispraises every order which is contrary to himself. In the politics of
                        this Country, I see that the ruling few praise exceedingly that order which
                        puts all things into their power; dispraise exceedingly all order which
                        would keep any thing out of their power.—Order, Sir, is a means to an end.
                        Unless, therefore, you tell us what is the end you propose by your order, it
                        may be an order of which we are not very likely to approve. When you tell
                        us, that you like order, we have to ask, What order? Good order? or bad?—Oh,
                        not bad!—You would put an end to bad order?—Certainly. So I thought. I could
                        not imagine otherwise. You and I, it appears, agree, in a greater number of
                        important points, than we supposed. Well, then, as you would put an end to
                        bad order, and only preserve good, do give us that important information,
                        how to know the one from the other.—Why, Sir, I reckon the present
                        government of this country good order; and your reform would introduce bad
                        order, because it would have no security either for life or property.—Sir,
                        that is just the answer I expected from you! therefore I am prepared for it.
                        You will observe, that if we divide answers into two sorts; one the
                        philosophical, another the vulgar; my petition looked to the philosophical;
                        it desired a scientific, that is, a general rule; instead of that you have
                        given me only a particular case. You have nevertheless mentioned something
                        which gives some obscure idea of what, if it were manufactured, your notion
                        of order would turn out to be. The order that reform would introduce would
                        be, you say, a bad order, on this account, That it would have no security
                        for life or property. Now this I have actually taken as the foundation of my
                        rule. I call an order good, just in proportion as it affords security for
                        life and property:</p>

                        life and property. We have then to examine by that test, what you have now
                        called good, and what you have called bad order. When the lives and property
                        of the many, are placed at the mercy of the few, is that a state in which
                        security for life and property does, or does not, exist?—There may be
                        security, in that case which you suppose, if the few are restrained by
                        law.—Restrained by law! that, Sir, is, when well examined, a very
                        extraordinary phrase for you to make use of on this occasion. The law, you
                        know, are words in books, standing on a shelf; and in themselves are as dead
                        and immovable as the paper on which they are written. They can restrain
                        nobody. Restraint means <del>force. By</del> the application of power,
                        active power. Men can be restrained only by men. Who then are the men that
                        restrain those, who alone have power? If the many are to be protected by
                        law; they must have two sorts of power; the power of determining what sort
                        of laws are to be made; and the power of making the laws be executed.
                        Without these powers, it is plain, that with regard to them, there is no
                        security for either life or property.</p>

                    <p><emph>Authority.</emph> “And the very objection the Jews made against our
                        blessed Saviour and the doctrine which he taught, that the guides and
                        governors of the Jewish Church did utterly differ from him; […] <hi
                            rend="underline">Have any of the rulers</hi>, say they, <hi
                            rend="underline">believed on him</hi>? What? Will you be wiser than your
                        rulers and governors? What? follow the doctrine of one single man against
                        the unanimous judgement and sentence of the great Sanhedrin, to whom the
                        trial of doctrines and pretended prophets doth of right belong?—But as
                        plausible as this objection may seem to be, it is to be considered that in a
                        corrupt and degenerate church, the guides and rulers of it are commonly the
                        worst, and the most deeply engaged in the errors and corruptions of it. They
                        brought them in at first, and their successors, who have been bred up in the
                        belief and practice of them, are concerned to uphold and maintain them; and
                        so long a prescription gives a kind of sacred stamp even to error, and an
                        authority not to be opposed and resisted.—Thus it was in the corrupt state
                        of the Jewish Church, in our Saviours time: and so likewise in that great
                        degeneracy of the Christian Church, in the times of popery, their rulers
                        made them to err: insomuch that when Martin Luther appeared in opposition to
                        the errors and superstitions of that church, and was hard pressed with this
                        very objection which the Pharisees urged against our Saviour, he was forced
                        to bolt out a kind of unmannerly truth, <emph>Religio nunquam magis

                        Martin Luther had done a very ill thing in breaking off from the church of
                        Rome, if nobody else would have joined with him in that honest design. And
                        yet if it had been so, I hope God would have given him the grace and courage
                        to have stood alone in so good and glorious a cause, and to have laid down
                        his life for it.—And for any man to be of another opinion, is just as if a

                        expose the vanity of all those popular systems and prejudices, which are to
                        be found in every country; derived originally from error, fraud, or
                        superstition; and craftily imposed upon the many, to serve the interests of
                        a few. Hence it is, that upon the detection of any of these, and especially
                        of the religious kind, we see all that rage of fierce bigots, hypocritical
                        zealots, and interested politicians; and of all whose credit or fortunes in
                        any manner depend on the establishment of error and ignorance among men. …
                        But truth was never known […] to have any other effect, than to promote the
                        general good. … Let the consequences then of truth reach as far as they can;
                        the farther they reach the better; the more errors they will detect, and the
                        more they will dissipate of those clouds and mists, in which the crafty and
                        interested part of mankind are apt to involve and disguise the real nature
                        of things from the view of their fellow creatures.” Middleton, Preface to

                        to suspect some latent imposture: now as sure as truth and falsehood are
                        contrary to each other; so sure it is, that the same method of treating them
                        cannot possibly be of service to both.—As far as my experience has reached,
                        either in ancient or modern history, there’s not an instance on record,
                        where a fair examination has ever done harm to a good cause. The attacks on
                        christianity, urged on by its warmest enemies, always turn to its advantage:
                        they engage the clergy to study and search into the true grounds of it; keep
                        them in breath and exercise; and train them by constant discipline, to be
                        able champions and defenders of it: they clear religion itself of all the
                        rust and rubbish, which by the negligence or the art of its managers, it may
                        have contracted: and, above all, they enforce and lay open the genuine
                        proofs of it, which by time itself, naturally grow languid and ineffectual;
                        till a new debate, like a new publication, sends them fresh again into the
                        world, in their original force and lustre.—’Tis then my firm principle and
                        persuasion, that a free inquiry into all points of religion, is always
                        useful and beneficial; and for that reason never to be punished or
                        prohibited. It opens the minds and reforms the manners of the people; makes
                        them reasonable, sociable, governable; easy to such as differ from them, and
                        so little scandalized at the different opinions, as the different complexion
                        of their neighbour: whereas the restraint of this liberty, and the
                        imposition of systems and articles, that must not be called in question,
                        nourishes a churlish spirit of bigotry, uncharitableness, enthusiasm, which
                        no civil power can moderate; a spirit that has so oft involved mankind in
                        wars and bloodshed; and by turns endangered the ruin of every Christian
                        country in the world.” Conyers Middleton, <emph>Remarks on Some Observations

                        that discovereth their errors, and thereby lesseneth their authority:
                        whereas the common peoples minds, unless they be tainted by dependence on

                        trusteth in the administration of the commonwealth; and consequently it is
                        duty to cause them so to be instructed; and not only his duty, but his

                        science and erroneous doctrines ignorance is in the middle: Natural sense
                        and imagination are not subject to absurdity: Nature itself cannot err, and
                        as men abound in copiousness of language, so they become more wise or more
                        mad than ordinary.” See another quotation from Hobbes, in
                            <emph>Parl[iamentary] Ref[orm</emph>], and one from Locke, stating those
                        who live on borrowed opinions as less qualified for correct judgement, than
                        those who have every thing to learn. To these considerations this may be
                        added, that the lowest of the people now are more instructed than the
                        aristocracy themselves were in former days when the constitution was framed.

                    <p>Jesus did not find the poor the class of men who were the least accessible to
                        reason, but by far the most so. Nay more, he told the world, that those
                        minds which were most in the state of the minds of little children, that is
                        minds, as without knowledge, so without the opinion of knowledge, were in
                        the state best adapted to the reception of sound doctrine. “Opinion of store
                        is one of the chief causes of want.” [L] The minds of those who call
                        themselves men of the better sort are full of a set of opinions, borrowed
                        from their nurses, which they make the standard of comparison with every
                        thing they hear. They are almost always therefore prepared to reject truth
                        rather than embrace it, because they try it by a wrong test, not by the test
                        of their reason, but the test of the old woman’s belief. When people are
                        willing to use the test of reason, those who are least benefited by previous
                        instruction are in little danger of going wrong. “For all men,” (says
                        Hobbes, <emph>Leviathan</emph>, p. 21, P. i, ch. 5) “by nature reason alike;
                        and well when they have good principles.” By principles, he understands
                        nothing but a correct definition of names, and adds, “For who is so stupid,
                        as both to mistake in geometry, and also to persist in it, when another
                        detects his error?” <note>Quotation in Latin from <emph>The Great

                        Socrates said that he was called the wisest of men, because knowing nothing,
                        he was aware of it—other people, also knowing nothing, believed they did

                        that are not so, but rather causes of the contrary.” Hobbes,
                            <emph>Leviathan</emph>, P. i, ch. 5. “Men […] appeal from custom to
                        reason, and from reason to custom, as it serves their turn, receding from
                        custom when their interest requires it, and setting themselves against
                        reason, as oft as reason is against them: Which is the cause that the
                        doctrine of right and wrong is perpetually disputed both by the fire and the
                        sword; whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not so, because men care
                        not in that subject what be truth as a thing that crosses no man’s ambition,
                        profit, or lust. For I doubt not but, if it had been a thing contrary to any
                        man’s right of dominion, or to the interest of men that have dominion, That
                        the three angles of a triangle should be equal to two angles of a square,
                        that doctrine should have been, if not disputed, yet by the burning of all
                        books of geometry, suppressed, as far as he whom it concerned was able.”

                        opinion? It does not mean that it rests upon a bad opinion of it prevalent
                        among the people. Every where, then, where government exists, the people
                        have been persuaded to have a good opinion of the government. It follows
                        that the people are very easily persuaded to have a good opinion of their
                        government. They have been easily persuaded to have a good opinion of
                        government, so long as it hurt them, it will be impossible to persuade them
                        to have a good opinion of it, say the antireformers, the moment it is made
                        capable of doing them good.—If you can trace a line of action, from the
                        first records of human nature to the present hour, in which those who are
                        called the people have steadily and almost uniformly, in all changes and in
                        all circumstances, acted in a particular manner; would you not, if any
                        modification were proposed in certain parts of the machinery of government
                        so as to make the whole thing play more smoothly, and more truly to its end,
                        would you not, in these circumstances, be a good deal surprised to find it
                        urged as a permanent objection, that men would be sure to act, in
                        consequence of that <del>change</del> modification, in a manner
                        diametrically opposite to that in which they had in all ages acted before—if
                        they had in all ages reared and taken care of their children, for example,
                        that after such a reform, they would cease to do so? Is it less absurd to
                        say that in all ages they have been easily persuaded to have a good opinion
                        of their government, but if you improve that government to the utmost, such
                        a persuasion will be impossible? Does experience stand more signally opposed
                        to any thing than this? <note>“Speech on the Reform of Representation in the

                        this injudicious conduct, has brought it to an end. This example is
                        extensively instructive. The principle that operates here, operates in every

                        of laws and government, it is assuredly a mere depravation and calumny,
                        without all shadow of truth. For to say that a blind custom of obedience
                        should be a surer obligation, than duty taught and understood, it is to
                        affirm that a blind man may tread surer by a guide, than a seeing man can by
                        a light. And it is without all controversy, that learning doth make the
                        minds of men gentle, generous, maniable, and pliant to government; whereas
                        ignorance makes them churlish, thwarting and mutinous: And the evidence of
                        time doth clear this assertion; considering that the most barbarous, rude,
                        and unlearned times have been most subject to tumults, seditions, and

                        requiring that a people should possess the virtues of liberty before they
                        obtain liberty, while it cannot acquire those virtues till after having
                        enjoyed liberty, since the effect cannot precede the cause. The first

                    <p>When any thing is proposed for the good of mankind, those whose interest
                        leads them to oppose it, have always, among other artifices, attempted to
                        make it the object of vague, indefinite fears. We may specify a number of
                        curious cases. To prevent the king from raising taxes without consent of
                        parliament was represented as not only involving it in the dissolution of
                        all government, but an absolute impossibility. See a curious passage in
                        proof of this fact, quoted by Hume, (Note Y) <emph>Hist.</emph>, v. VI, p.
                        576. Hume says, (<emph>Ib.</emph>, p. 307) that in “the age of Charles, the
                        liberty of the press was totally unknown, and was generally deemed, as well
                        as religious toleration, incompatible with all good government.” Even the
                        removal of the Star-Chamber was represented as in the highest degree
                        dangerous; and Hume says upon the occasion, “It must be confessed, that the
                        experiment here made by the parliament, was not a little rash and
                        adventurous. No government at that time appeared in the world, nor is
                        perhaps to be found in the records of any history, which subsisted without
                        the mixture of some arbitrary authority, committed to some magistrate; and
                        it might reasonably, beforehand, appear doubtful whether human society could
                        ever reach that state of perfection, as to support itself with no other
                        control than the general and rigid maxims of law and equity. But the
                        parliament justly thought, that the king was too eminent a magistrate to be
                        trusted with discretionary power, which he might so easily turn to the
                        destruction of liberty. And in the court it has hitherto been found, that,
                        though some sensible inconveniencies arise from the maxim of adhering
                        strictly to the law, yet the advantages overbalance them, and should render
                        the English grateful to the memory of their ancestors, who, after repeated
                        contests, at last established that noble, though dangerous principle.”

                        <emph>Misunderstanding the Spirit of the Times.</emph> “While the Commons
                        were thus warmly engaged against Buckingham, the king seemed desirous of
                        embracing every opportunity by which he could express a contempt and
                        disregard for them. No one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the
                        great might which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution. The
                        history of England had never hitherto afforded one instance where any great
                        movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower house. And as their
                        rank, both considered in a body and as individuals, was but the second in
                        the kingdom; nothing less than fatal experience could engage the English
                        princes to pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable
                        assembly.” Hume, <emph>Hist.</emph>, VI, 217. NB What the commons in
                        parliament were then, the commons in aggregate, by the aid of the press are

                        <emph>Vague Fears.</emph> To the instances in the preceding page of vague
                        fears applied to prevent the existence of good things, add the following.
                        “Till the revolution, the liberty of the press was very imperfectly enjoyed
                        in England, and during a very short period. The star-chamber, while that
                        court subsisted, put effectual restraints upon printing. On the suppression
                        of that tribunal in 1641, the long parliament, after their rupture with the
                        king, assumed the same power with regard to the licensing of books; and this
                        authority was continued during all the period of the republic and the
                        protectorship. Two years after the restoration, an act was passed reviving
                        the republican ordinances. This act expired in 1679; but was revived in the
                        first of king James. The liberty of the press did not even commence with the
                        revolution. It was not till 1694 that the restraints were taken off; to the
                        great displeasure of the king, and his ministers, who, seeing no where, in
                        any government, during present or past ages, any example of such unlimited
                        freedom, doubted much of its salutary effects, and probably thought, that no
                        books or writings would ever so much improve the general understanding of
                        men, as to render it safe to entrust them with an indulgence so easily
                        abused.” Hume, <emph>Hist.</emph>, VIII, 331, 332. The reformation proposed
                        by Luther was opposed as a thing “which threatened to overthrow property,
                        and dissolve the bonds which unite civil society.” These are the words of an
                        address from the pope to the German Diet, delivered 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        November 1552. See Bower’s <emph>Life of Luther</emph>, p. 198. See to the
                        same purpose certain quotations from Paul’s <emph>Council of Trent</emph>,
                        quoted above in <emph>Parl. Ref.</emph> to shew the fears with which all
                        reformation of the Romish church was opposed, at the time of Luther; and a
                        curious passage in the same place from Bossuet, which ascribes the overthrow
                        of the Romish church in so many parts of Europe, to the fatal error of not
                        reforming herself. So that if there is a danger from reform, there is still
                        greater danger from non-reform. Great apprehension was expressed at teaching
                        the common people to read and write. Great apprehension was expressed, at
                        giving to the people the bible in their own tongue. The slave masters in the
                        West Indies expressed great fears, at abolishing the slave trade. Mention a
                        single thing, of any importance, that ever has been done to ameliorate the
                        condition of mankind, and I will shew you a thing which has been held up as
                        an object to be dreaded and shunned. <note>Hume, <emph>The History of

                        threats, while she asks their support, must offer her own. If we attack
                        oppressors before we have taught the oppressed, we shall risk the loss of
                        liberty, and the death of reason. History affords proof of this truth. How
                        often, despite the generous efforts of the friends of freedom, has a single
                        battle reduced nations to the slavery of ages!—and what is the kind of
                        liberty enjoyed by those nations which have recovered it by force of arms,
                        and not by the force of reason? It has been temporary freedom, and so
                        disturbed by storms, that it remains doubtful whether it were or were not an
                        advantage. Have not most of them confounded the forms of republicanism with
                        the enjoyment of right, and the despotism of numbers with freedom? How many
                        unjust laws, contrary to the rights of nature, have dishonoured the code of
                        all nations which have recovered their liberty, during those ages in which
                        reason was still in its childhood!—Why not profit by this fatal experience,
                        and wisely wait the progress of knowledge, in order to obtain freedom more
                        effectual, more substantial, and more peaceful? Why purchase it by torrents
                        of blood, and inevitable confusion, and give that to chance which time must
                        certainly and without bloodshed bestow? In order to be more free, and to be
                        ever so, we should wait the time when men, released from their prejudices
                        and guided by reason, will be worthy of freedom, because they will know what
                        are its true claims.” [F] Condorcet, <emph>Vie de Voltaire</emph>, p. 173.

                        conclusive argument against it. In his <emph>Leviathan</emph>, ch. xxxii, or
                        the first of a Christian commonwealth, he says, “We are not to renounce our
                        senses and experience, nor (that which is the undoubted word of God) our
                        natural reason.” Again, in the next, “It is true that God is the sovereign
                        of all sovereigns; and, therefore, when he speaks to any subject, he ought
                        to be obeyed, whatsoever any earthly potentate command to the contrary.”
                        Whatsoever, then, our natural reason commands, is to be obeyed in opposition
                        to the commands of any earthly potentate. <note>pp. 195,199, P. III, c. 32,

                        There is something in this expression so very simple, that one is disposed,
                        on hearing it, rather to smile, than to speak. To bid people love
                        institutions is about as wise as to bid them love things in general.
                        Institutions! Establishments! What may these terms mean? Nothing, possibly,
                        can they mean, at bottom, but the mode, or forms, according to which the
                        business of government is performed, if political; the mode or forms
                        according to which religious services are performed, if religious; the mode
                        or forms according to which the business of religion [<emph>sic</emph>
                        education] is performed, if institutions for education. Now, setting
                        religion altogether out of the question, no man but likes government and
                        education. Institutions are the means to these ends. A man is not to love
                        means but in proportion as he thinks them conducive to these ends.</p>

                        and persuade as many people as they can to dislike [it] along with them.—How
                        do you mean? Sir I do not fully understand you.—Let us use a more limited
                        expression, which perhaps may lead us to some understanding of the more
                        extended [kind]. Are not you one of those persons who are sometimes afraid

                        that opinion.—Now, then, let us consider, exactly, if we can, what this
                        imports. I suppose you will allow, that there is no use in reasoning with
                        those persons who are afraid to follow reason, wherever it leads.—Why
                        so?—Because if in discoursing with such a person, I should make it out ever
                        so clearly, that things are so and so, in reason; I am never an atom the
                        nearer my object, which was to obtain the concurrence of <del>such a</del>
                        said person. I have therefore reasoned in vain. My discourse has been of no
                            <del>use</del> avail. To reason with such a person is, therefore,
                        totally useless. Now let us go back to that which we called the Dislike of
                        Reason. Shall we examine whether the notions which we two hold under this
                        denomination are the same, or different?—Certainly; that seems necessary.—We
                        must state, then, what we each of us understand, in using that term; and
                        then compare them. Will you then, take precedence, and state your conception
                        first? Or had you rather that I should state my notion first?</p>

                        the search after truth; inasmuch as—by the perpetual huntings after apparent
                        and partial agreements and disagreements, […] that are very different or
                        quite opposite—a man must by degrees pervert all his notions of things
                        themselves, and become unable to see them as they really are, and as they
                        appear to considerate sober-minded inquirers. He must lose all his
                        associations of the visible ideas of things, their names, symbols, etc.,
                        with their useful practical relations and properties; and get, in their
                        stead, accidental, indirect, and unnatural conjunctions of circumstances,
                        that are really foreign to each other, or oppositions of those that are
                        united; and, after some time, habit and custom will fix these upon him.”

                    <p>Mill’s interest in literature was largely for what it told him about
                        language, and that from the standpoint of the not entirely lucid theories of
                        John Horne Tooke’s <emph>The Diversions of Purley</emph>. We have here as
                        well a defence of the heavy style of his <emph>History of British
                            India</emph>, which nearly every critic noted (not even the prince of
                        elephantine stylists, Bentham, could resist a comment on it). Note, for
                        example, the Seneca quotation at <ref target="cpb3ch7scrap178r">178r</ref>.
                        Despite his knowledge of some of the philosophical discussions of
                        aesthetics, there seems to be little except preparatory ammunition for a
                        defence of his <emph>History</emph> here.</p>
                    <p>Though some, if not a major part of this material, comes from the pre-1818
                        period, the section rather clearly is one that was put together after the
                        publication of his <emph>History</emph> in 1818, and despite the shortness
                        of it, continued to have some importance to him (the last item is
                        post-1825). One sign that this subject did not engage his attention too
                        closely may be the number of quotations included in this section which
                        really do not fit it, or rather might fit nearly anywhere. See, for example,
                        the items by Johnson, Alison, Turgot, and Hall.</p>

                        the contending philosophers) “it is not reason which carries the prize, but
                        eloquence; and no man needs ever despair of gaining proselytes to the most
                        extravagant hypothesis, who has art enough to represent it in any favourable

                    <p>“I need not say, my bretheren, what a field is opened to the benevolence of
                        knowledge: I need not tell you, that in every department of learning there
                        is good to be done to mankind: I need not remind you that the age in which
                        we live has given us the noblest examples of this kind, and that science now
                        finds its highest glory in improving the condition, or in allaying the
                        miseries of humanity. But there is one thing of which it is proper ever to
                        remind you, because the modesty of knowledge often leads us to forget
                        it,—and that is, that the power of scientific benevolence is far greater
                        than that of all others, to the welfare of society. The benevolence of the
                        great, or the opulent, however eminent it may be, perishes with themselves.
                        The benevolence even of sovereigns is limited to the narrow boundary of
                        human life; and not unfrequently is succeeded by different and discordant
                        counsels. But the benevolence of knowledge is of a kind as extensive as the
                        race of man, and as permanent as the existence of society. He, in whatever
                        situation he may be, who, in the study of science, has discovered a new
                        means of alleviating pain, or of remedying disease; who has described a
                        wiser method of preventing poverty, or of shielding misfortune; who has
                        suggested additional means of increasing or improving the beneficial
                        productions of nature, has left a memorial of himself, which can never be
                        forgotten, and which will communicate happiness to ages yet unborn; and
                        which, in the emphatic language of scripture, renders him a fellow-worker
                        with God himself, in the improvement of his creation.” Alison’s

                    <p>“The first time that he gave a report to the King, M. Turgot believed that he
                        ought to summarize in as few words as possible the main question. He covered
                        everything, and he gave it with a severe concision. His work was approved
                        but fatigued his hearers; and when the Counsel finished, the majority of
                        those Counsellors of State (Privy Counsellors) who had taken a true interest
                        in him said to him: ‘You have spoken very well, but you have been a bit
                        long; another time abridge your speech a bit.’ M. Turgot, to whom it would
                        have been impossible to abridge his speech more, understood from whence came
                        the effect of which they complained. In his second report, he took a
                        different path. He gave in excess the facts in detail and the
                            <emph>means</emph> which he had to make known; he gave a resumé of each
                        part of his report before he passed on to the next part; and he gave a
                        resumé of all of them a second time on finishing. ‘You have been well
                        corrected,’ they said to him, ‘you have said much more, and you have been

                        his aid to collect and publish a body of revolutionary speeches. He says,
                        ‘Of all the speeches made in congress, from 1774 to 1777 inclusive of both
                        years, not one sentence remains, except a few periods of Dr. Witherspoon,
                        printed in his works.’ His concluding sentence is very strong: ‘In plain
                        English, and in a few words, Mr. Niles, I consider the true history of the
                        American revolution, and the establishment of our present constitutions, as
                        lost for ever; and nothing but misrepresentations, or partial accounts of it

                        to their phrases and forms of declamation, I am persuaded I might represent
                        fine tragedies beforehand. And this will be such an objection, that—although
                        I am most confident I shall make it apparent to be as false and scandalous
                        as the objectors themselves are zealous and impatient; yet—besides that I
                        believe the objection will come where my answers will not come, or not be
                        understood—I am also confident that—in defiance and incuriousness of all
                        that I shall say, some men will persist pertinaciously in the accusation,
                        and deny my conclusions in despite of me.” Jeremy Taylor, Epist. Dedic. to

                    <p>“The intendment of my discourse is—that permission should be in questions
                        speculative, indeterminable, curious, and unnecessary; and that men would
                        not make more necessities than God made, which indeed are not many. The
                        fault I find, and seek to remedy is—that men are so dogmatical and resolute
                        in their opinions, and impatient of others disagreeings, in those things
                        wherein is no sufficient means of union and determination. … If a doctrine
                        is not so revealed but that wise and good men may differ in their opinions,
                        it is a clear case it is not <emph>inter dogmatica necessaria
                            simpliciter</emph> [simply the essentials of Christian faith]; and then
                        it is certain I may therefore safely disbelieve it. … All the obligation we
                        are capable of is, not to be malicious or voluntarily criminal in any kind;
                        and then if [by accident] we find out a truth, we are obliged to believe it,
                        and so will every wise or good man do; indeed he cannot do otherwise. But if
                        he disbelieves an article without malice or design, or involuntarily [or
                        unknowingly], it is a contradiction to say it is a sin. …” <emph>Ib.</emph>

                        live upon it at a venture: and when all their confidence is built upon zeal
                        and mistake, yet therefore because they are zealous and mistaken, they are

                        glorious appellation of faith, this objection would have no pretence or

                    <p>Faith never can be a virtue, nor disbelief a crime (<emph>in foro
                            rationis</emph>) [in the forum of reason]. What a man believes, he
                        believes upon evidence; what he disbelieves, he disbelieves for want of
                        evidence. A man may be culpable, or not culpable, in looking out for
                        evidence, in the care to instruct himself—but this is a different thing from
                        belief or non belief. A man never can be guilty for not believing what he
                        sees no sufficient reason for believing—he may be guilty, say[s] Jeremy
                        Taylor, for a wilful resolution not to believe. But a man cannot resolve not
                        to believe what he sees reason to believe, because then he does believe,
                        whether he will or not. He may indeed <hi rend="underline">act</hi> as if he
                        did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> believe; but this is insincerity, not
                        disbelief. <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>, 443-53, § 1.</note></p>
                    <p>Jeremy Taylor however says well, that opinions, true as well as false, take
                        their origin from affections; and that as the affection is from which they
                        spring, such is the demerit or the innocence of them —If they arise from
                        pride, covetousness, revenge, or any other bad passion, they are so far
                        vicious as the passion is. See Jeremy Taylor, <emph>Liberty of
                            Prophesying</emph>, Sect. 2, § 7-8. <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>,

                    <p>“Seventhly, It is unnatural and unreasonable to persecute disagreeing

                    <p>prudent government punish the offender to prevent a future crime, and so it
                        proves more medicinal than vindictive, the punitive act being in order to
                        the cure and prevention; and since no punishment of the body can cure a
                        disease in the soul; it is disproportionable in nature, and in all civil
                        government, to punish where the punishment can do no good. It may be an act
                        of tyranny, but never of justice. For is an opinion ever the more true or
                        false for being persecuted? Some men have believed it the more, as being
                        provoked into a confidence, and vexed into a resolution; but the thing
                        itself is not the truer: and though the hangman may confute a man with an
                        inextricable dilemma, yet not convince his understanding; for such premises
                        can infer no conclusion but that of a man’s life; and a wolf may as well
                        give laws to the understanding as he whose dictates are onely propounded in
                        violence, and writ in blood: and a dog is as capable of a law as a man, if
                        there be no choice in his obedience, nor discourse in his choice, nor reason
                        to satisfy his discourse. And as it is unnatural, so it is unreasonable,
                        that Sempronius should force Caius to be of his opinion, because Sempronius
                        is consul this year and commands the lictors. As if he that can kill a man
                        cannot but be infallible! […]—Eighthly, Force, in matters of opinion can do
                        no good, but is very apt to do hurt; for no man can change his opinion when
                        he will, or be satisfied in his reason that his opinion is false, because
                        discountenanced. If a man could change his opinion when he lists, he might
                        cure many inconveniences of his life: all his fears and his sorrows would
                        soon disband, if he would but alter his opinion, whereby he is persuaded
                        that such an accident that afflicts him is an evil, and such an object
                        formidable: let him but believe himself impregnable, or that he receives a
                        benefit when he is plundered, disgraced, imprisoned, condemned and
                        afflicted, neither his steps need to be disturbed nor his quietness
                        discomposed. But if a man cannot change his opinion when he lists, nor ever
                        does heartily or resolutely but when he cannot do otherwise, then to use
                        force may make him an hypocrite but never to be a right believer; and so,
                        instead of erecting a trophy to God and true religion, we build a monument

                        no more.” Bp. Warburton, in his <emph>Remarks on Neal’s Hist. of

                        and sincere, which I think must be granted, it would follow that he knew

                        was owing to the misconduct of Laud, driving at things contrary to “the

                    <p>Whenever you allow all religions, indifferentism is the best thing for the

                        to think in earnest; and what is the consequence? Every man’s particular
                        turn of mind, gives him then particular views. Sects become multiplied; and
                        it is only a small portion, whose views will coincide with the
                        establishment. All attempts therefore to excite the spirit of religion are

                            against religion, as much as they please: I should be heartily sorry,

                            great a disservice were done to religion, as to check its adversaries,
                            in any other way, than by returning a candid answer to their

                            Adversary, whom the Laws had before disarmed; or value a Victory, where

                    <p>“Nothing offends our feelings more, than the progress of destruction urged by
                            <emph>religious zeal</emph>: as it allows men to suppose themselves
                        agents of the divinity; thereby removing those checks which interfere with
                        the perpetration of ordinary villainy.” Rennel, <emph>Mem. of a map of
                            Hindustan</emph>, Introd., p. xlvi. Speaking of the destruction of the
                        Mahomedan conquests.—NB It is a truth, that religion is generally made use
                        of, as a bulwark against the ordinary motives to morality. A man always
                        shapes his religion to forbid or command just as he pleases—to favour his
                        own passions—and disfavour those of his neighbours. The reason that religion
                        does not command stealing is because thieves have not the making of it—but
                        men who know it is their interest there should be no thieves. Religion is
                        thus made good by the moral sanction—not the moral sanction ameliorated by
                        religion. <note>James Rennell, <emph>Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan</emph>,

                    <p>Ld. Roscommon had a supernatural intimation of his father’s death. This
                        asserted by his tutor. The story declared to be worthy of attention by Dr.
                        Johnson, who says that hardly any fact can be more completely proved by
                        testimony—the testifier being not liable to be deceived, and having no
                        motive to deceive. We are left he says to decide between reason and
                        testimony. Johnson, <emph>Life of Roscommon.</emph>

                    <p>Warburton is chiefly angry at the use of ridicule against religion. “Cheats,”
                        says Johnson (<emph>Life of Butler</emph>), “can seldom stand long against
                        laughter.” Is this the reason? <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>, 198.</note></p>

                    <p>“When the inscription for the monument of [Edward] Philips, in which he was
                        said to be <emph>soli Miltono secundus</emph> [Second to Milton the sun],
                        was exhibited to Dr. Sprat, then dean of Westminster, he refused to admit
                        it; the name of Milton was in his opinion too detestable to be read on the
                        wall of a building dedicated to devotion. Atterbury, who succeeded him,
                        being author of the inscription, permitted its reception. ‘And such has been
                        the change of public opinion,’ said Dr. Gregory, from whom I heard this
                        account, ‘that I have seen erected in the church a statue of that man, whose
                        name I once knew considered as a pollution of its walls.’” Johnson,

                    <p>That the oath of a Catholic priest implies nothing derogatory from his duty
                        to his king and country is proved by the following words of Bossuet. He is
                        remarking on Burnet’s account of the oath of fidelity to the pope, taken
                        upon his [Cranmer’s] elevation to the see of Canterbury. Burnet says he took
                        the oath, with a protestation <del>in favour</del> reserving his duty toward
                        his conscience, his king, and country: “A protestation in itself quite
                        needless; for who of us imagines he engages himself by this oath to anything
                        that is contrary to his conscience, or the service of his king and country?
                        Far from thinking we prejudice any of these, it is even expressed in the
                        oath, that we take it without prejudice to the rights of our order,
                            <emph>Salvo ordine meo.</emph> The submission, which is sworn to the
                        Pope in spirituals, is of a different order from what we naturally owe our
                        Prince in temporals, and without protesting, we have always well understood,
                        that one does not interfere with the other.” [F] Bossuet, <emph>Hist. des
                            Variations des Eglises Protestantes</emph>, liv. vii, § 11.

                    <p>Warburton (<emph>Divine Legation</emph>, B. I, § 1) says that the external
                        evidence of Christianity is not so satisfactory as the internal, and always
                        grows weaker and weaker. He adds; “Nay so necessary is the
                            <emph>internal</emph> evidence, that, even the very best of the external
                        kind cannot support itself without it. As may be seen from hence, that when
                        the miracles performed by the founders of our holy faith, are unquestionably
                        verified by human testimony, the consequence, that therefore they were
                        wrought by divine power, cannot be deduced ’till the nature of that doctrine
                        be examined, for whose establishment they were performed.”—NB Thus human
                        reason is the measure and criterion of revelation. <note><emph>The Divine

                        procedure, or to give one party a hearing and not allow the other to speak
                        on its own behalf what it thinks is to its own advantage. [No, they say that
                        both sides must be given an equal hearing, so that by comparing the opposing
                        arguments they may be assisted in discovering the true and the false.”] [G]

                        names. Every man pants for the highest eminence within his view; none,

                        beings, and very few have, by magnanimity or piety, been so raised above it,
                        as to act wholly without regard to censure or opinion. … Among the
                        innumerable bidders for praise, some are willing to purchase at the highest

                        (says Bayle, of the abbé of St. Denys, persecutor of Abelard in his account

                        opportunity of blending state crimes with a charge of false doctrine; a
                        circumstance these gentlemen never forget to make their vengeance sure. This
                        artifice has been so often used since the Jews employed it against our
                        Saviour (<emph>Luke</emph> 23. 2), that it is surprising people dare
                        practise it in these times; for should not those persons be afraid, that so
                        base, so threadbare a stratagem would seduce us no longer? To this I answer,
                        there is no reason they should entertain such fears, mankind being so
                        unruly, as never to be warned by the weakness of past times. Every age acts
                        as though it were the first, and as the spirit of persecution and of revenge
                        has hitherto succeeded in implicating sovereign powers in its particular
                        feuds, they will strive to continue this practice to the end of the world.

                    <p>“An alliance between Church and State in a Christian Commonwealth is, in my
                        opinion, an idle and a fanciful speculation. An alliance is between two
                        things that are in their nature distinct and independent, such as between
                        two sovereign states. But in a Christian Commonwealth, the church and the
                        state are one and the same thing, being different integral parts of the same
                        whole. For the Church has been always divided into two parts, the clergy and
                        the laity; of which the laity is as much an essential integral part, and has
                        as much its duties and privileges, as the clerical member; and in the rule,
                        order and government of the church, has its share.” Burke’s

                    <p>The existence of matter according to Berkley (<emph>Principles of Human
                            Knowl.</emph>, § 53) is inconsistent with the idea of God. Matter is
                        inert—is inactive—can do nothing—every thing which appears to be done by the
                        qualities of matter, must be done by the immediate agency of God—therefore,
                        of what use is the matter—every thing might as well be done without it. NB
                        His argument may be applied this way—since matter is created, matter is not
                        inert—God would not have created it—if so—But if it is not inert—if it
                        operates by itself—what is to hinder it to have operated all that we see?

                    <p>Strictly speaking, according to Berkley, men cannot believe what they do not
                        understand. His words are (<emph>Ib.</emph>, § 54) “Strictly speaking, to
                        believe that which involves a contradiction, or has no meaning in it, is
                        impossible. […] In one sense, indeed, men may be said to believe that matter
                        exists, that is, they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations,
                        which affects them every moment and is so nearly present to them, were some
                        senseless unthinking being. But that they should clearly apprehend any
                        meaning marked by those words, and form thereof a settled speculative
                        opinion, is what I am not able to conceive. This is not the only instance
                        wherein men impose upon themselves, by imagining they believe those
                        propositions they have often heard, though at bottom they have no meaning in
                        them.”—What has no meaning in it, and what has no meaning that is
                        perceivable, that is what is unintelligible, are to the individual to whom
                        it is unintelligible the same thing. Therefore no one ever believed in the
                        trinity. <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>, 49-50.</note></p>
                    <p>Space, as well as God, is eternal, uncreated, infinite, indivisible,

                        252. It is not like an estate, because it is not inheritable. To render

                        is useful, because on that permanence depends the motive of industry. There
                        is no use at all in any permanence in the provision for the clergy.

                    <p><emph>Against.</emph> “In the Review of last month, I met with an account of
                        a sermon preached by Mr. Paley, at the consecration of his friend Bishop
                        Law. The critic admires and extols the preacher, and devoutly prays the lord
                        of the harvest to send forth more such labourers into his vineyard. I rather
                        differ from him in opinion, not being able to conjecture in what respect the
                        vineyard will be benefited by such a measure. He is certainly ingenious, and
                        has stretched his ingenuity to the uttermost in order to exhibit the church
                        established, consisting of bishops, priests, and deacons, in the most
                        favourable point of view. […] I lay it down for a rule, that when much
                        ingenuity is necessary to gain an argument credit, that argument is unsound
                        at bottom. So is his, and so are all the petty devices, by which he seeks to
                        enforce it. He says first, that the appointment of various orders in the
                        church, is attended with this good consequence, that each class of people is
                        supplied with a clergy of their own kind and description, with whom they may
                        live and associate on terms of equality. But in order to effect this good
                        purpose, there ought to be at least three parsons in every parish, one for
                        the gentry, one for the traders and mechanics, and one for the lowest of the
                        vulgar. Neither is it easy to find many parishes, where the laity at large
                        have any society</p>

                    <p>with their minister at all. This therefore is fanciful, and a mere invention.
                        In the next place, he says it gives a dignity to the ministry itself; and
                        the clergy share in the respect paid to their superiors. Much good may such
                        participation do them! They themselves know how little it amounts to. The
                        dignity a parson derives from the lawn-sleeves and square cap of his
                        diocesan will never endanger his humility.—Pope says truly—‘Worth makes the
                        man, and want of it the fellow; The rest is all but leather or
                        prunello.’—Again, ‘Rich and splendid situations in the church, have been
                        justly regarded as prizes, held out to invite persons of good hopes and
                        ingenuous attainments.’ Agreed. But the prize held out in the Scripture, is
                        of a very different kind; and our ecclesiastical baits are too often snapped
                        by the worthless, and persons of no attainments at all. They are indeed
                        incentives to avarice and ambition; but not to those acquirements by which
                        only the ministerial function can be adorned, zeal for the salvation of men,
                        humility, and self-denial. Mr. Paley and I therefore cannot agree.”

                    <p>Dean Swift supposed a race of Struldbrugs, among other men who were mortal.
                        Let us suppose a race of men who are stationary, among others who are
                        progressive. What situation would they be in; and by what motives would they
                        be directed? Would it not be their interest to oppose the progress of the
                        others as much as they could? Would it not be their interest to prevent
                        themselves from sinking into a state of degradation; by the others rising
                        up, and getting far above them? Would it not be their interest, therefore,
                        to labour, might and main, to prevent progression; to chain down the human
                        mind; to prevent improvement; to decry it by every artifice, to call it
                        Jacobinism, anarchy; to call down punishment upon it—to crush it by laws; to
                        make men afraid of it; to attach to it the imagination of all sorts of evil
                        consequences.—Now, are not clergymen in this situation? Are they not men who
                        are bound down, and condemned to be stationary? Have they not sworn that
                        they will make no progression?—Yes; but only in religion.—Let us see how far
                        that extends. The clergyman swears that he will make no progression in
                        religion. That form, to which he swears, may be perfect, or imperfect. At
                        the time he believes it perfect; but he cannot be sure; he is not
                        infallible; and he cannot tell what a greater share of knowledge might
                        hereafter lead him to think. He swears to abide by it, whether it is good or
                        bad. Now <del>let any body tell me what is the difference</del> then what
                        are his interests? Is it not his interest, that men should <del>never be
                            induced to think it bad? Has he not, therefore, reason therefore to
                            dread</del> continue to think it good, even if it should be in reality
                        bad? It assuredly is. If it be bad, is any thing so likely to discover that
                        quality, and make its badness known, as the progress of knowledge? Nothing.
                        Is there any thing, therefore, the clergyman has so much reason to dread, as
                        the progress of knowledge? The clergyman is bound not only by his oath, but
                        also by an overbearing weight of interest to remain stationary in point of
                        religion. But the fact is, that the moment a man has made it his interest to
                        maintain for true any one point of knowledge, whether it be true or not
                        true; provided any considerable portion of his reputation and consequence
                            <del>depend upon</del> are involved in the identity of other men’s
                        belief with his profession of belief, the case is the same; the progress of
                        knowledge is hostile to him, and he is hostile to the progress of knowledge.
                            <del>The It is at least an even chance that</del> The progress of
                        knowledge <del>will</del> can do him no good; and it is an even chance that

                        those who are the professors of piety, are most remarkably afraid of
                        ridicule, (NB some good things in Shaftesbury on this subject) yet the

                            will then redouble their Disguise, involve themselves in Mysteriousness,
                            and talk so as hardly to be understood, or at least not plainly
                            interpreted, by those who are dispos’d to do ’em a mischief. And thus

                    <p><emph>Against.</emph> A paid clergyman ought not to be received as evidence
                        upon a question of the truth of religion, or the utility of his church. The
                        law says so. If he had a shilling’s interest in the suit, the courts of law
                        would not receive his interest [<emph>sic</emph> evidence]. To hire and pay
                        a priesthood, is the direct way to deprive yourself of all security for
                        their being sincere, that they are any thing but impostors. To pay them is
                        altogether to unfit them for their office.—The true religion never ought to
                        have a priest—must suffer by having a priesthood. False religions stand in
                        need of [a] priesthood, and cannot do without one.</p>
                    <p><emph>Religion</emph>, suppressing liberty of conscience, is a contradiction;
                        because religion, not according to a man’s conscience, can be to have no
                        religion at all. Harrington. <note><emph>The Art of Lawgiving</emph>, B.
                            III, c. 2, in <emph>Works</emph>, pp. 448-51. Harrington does, however,
                            argue the case for a national church in this chapter.</note></p>

                    <p>In the Scriptures are contradictory passages without end. And the use made of
                        them is admirable. It is first of all resolved, that they are not
                        contradictory. Next, being really contradictory, all propositions in the
                        world may be supported either by one or another of them.</p>
                    <p>Holding forth rewards to the Church-of-England men or Christians, and
                        inflicting punishments for the contrary are ways in which any one set of
                        opinions may be supported just as well as another. There is nothing so
                        absurd which people may not be held to profess they believe in this manner.
                        Opinions that are professed on these terms have no title to regard on
                        account of the numbers who profess them. Opinions so professed are the
                        natural objects of suspicion. Because if they could maintain themselves on
                        the ground of reason, they would not have the need of rewards and
                        punishments.</p>

                        upon the words of scripture, and says you shall hold this interpretation
                        under pains and penalties, this is to be antichrist. This, says
                        Chillingworth, “I say, and will maintain, howsoever you dawb and disguise
                        it, is to make men apostate from Christ, to his pretended Vicar, but real
                        enemy. For that name, and no better (if we may speak truth without offence)
                        I presume he deserves, who under pretence of interpreting the law of Christ
                        (which authority without any word of express warrant he hath taken upon
                        himself) doth in many parts evacuate and dissolve it: So dethroning Christ
                        from his Dominion over mens consciences, and, instead of Christ, setting up
                        himself. In as much as he that requires that his interpretations of any law
                        should be obeyed as true and genuine, […] requires, indeed, that his
                        interpretations should be the laws. … And, whatsoever he may plead, yet,
                        either wittingly, or ignorantly, he makes the law and the law-maker both

                    <p>To reward or punish people for <del>holding</del> professing this or that
                        opinion, is an act of a barbarous age. If the act has taken root in a
                        barbarous age, it may receive protection, from a set of sinister interests,
                        in one comparatively enlightened. The government of Great Britain at the
                        present moment supports by rewards and punishments certain opinions, which
                        began to be supported in the same way many centuries ago. But it would never
                        think of setting up a new opinion, and supporting <hi rend="underline"
                            >that</hi> by rewards and punishments. Yet why should it not? It is much
                        more capable of devising good opinions, than the government of Great Britain
                        was, at the time when the <del>present</del> opinions now rewarded and
                        punished were set upon that trust-worthy foundation.</p>

                    <p>There is one description of opinions which I think are always at first sight
                        to be presumed to be false. Those are, all opinions which any thing but
                        reason is employed to produce the belief of; all opinions to the belief of
                        which any thing that can be called reward, to the disbelief of which any
                        thing that can be called punishment is applied. One thing is certain, that
                        the love of truth never could be the motive for the attaching of these
                        inducements; because these are inducements calculated to be as potent in
                        favour of error as in favour of truth; but if not the true truth led to the
                        formation of these rewards and punishments, the unavoidable presumption is,
                        that they are employed in favour of what is not truth; what those persons
                        had an interest in getting believed, though incapable of being supported by

                        use of his reason, do you represent yourself as entitled to reward? Do you
                        not put him in fear, in order to extort his reason from him, when you apply
                        penalties to the holding of any opinion? If reason would lead him to those
                        opinions, your penalties are useless; if reason would not lead him to those

                        one of infinitely greater moment than a pecuniary interest depends, are you

                        of what a witness is saying, and they cannot understand his words they use
                        an interpreter, and everything becomes clear. It follows therefore, that
                        everything that he has said which is unclear is not written down.” [L]

                    <p>If I am asked to believe in any body’s interpretation of the bible; it is in
                        the interpreter, not in the bible, that I am asked to believe. It is no
                        longer faith in God that is asked of me, it is faith in the priest. If you
                        say no—it is not faith in the priest, I ask you, what faith in the priest
                            <hi rend="underline">can be</hi>, if it is not this? Faith in any man,
                        appears to me to be, the taking any thing upon his word, as being a
                        sufficient ground of belief. If you say that it is not faith in the priest,
                        but faith in God through the priest, I am of opinion that it is wholly a
                        deception to call this faith in God. To <del>believe in</del> have faith in
                        God, is to believe on the word of God, but you believe not on the word of
                        God, but the word of the priest. The priest tells you that something is the
                        word of God, but you know not that, of yourself, you take his word for it.
                        Your belief is solely bottomed on his word. Church-of-Englandism is belief,
                        therefore, not in God, but in the priest. The reason has been given. <hi

                    <p>To prove that religion has little effect in producing good conduct among
                        mankind, Helvetius says, that speculative dogmas never have any considerable
                        effect upon conduct. The doctrine of fatalism, he says, ought to destroy
                        morality. Yet the Stoics were not the least, but the most moral among their
                        contemporaries. The Calvinistic doctrine is destructive of morality, yet the
                        Calvinists are not the least moral of Christians. The doctrine of repentance
                        is destructive of morality. Yet all believing Christians are not immoral.

                        last to the spring of truth. In morality, the thing really useful, is the
                        inquiry after truth, and the non-inquiry that is really detrimental. He that

                        its evidence.] An honest man will always obey his reason in preference to
                        revelation; for it is, he will say, more certain that God is the author of

                    <p>It is said that the mind may be governed by religious prejudices without
                        being weakened in <del>other</del> its power of pursuing and discerning
                        other truth. This is as much as to say, that a mind can have a confirmed
                        habit of receiving opinions without exploring the evidence, in one subject,
                        without having it, more or less, in all subjects. It appears to me, that the
                        strength of the mind, that is to say, its power of discerning truth, and
                        detecting error, consists in the habit of vigilantly and as much as possible
                        invariably, seeing through the evidence upon which every article of belief
                        is rested. Now if a habit of looking through and through the evidence of
                        every opinion, exploring where the evidence is sound, where it has any the
                        minutest flaw, is fairly acquired, and carried through every subject, it is
                        not possible it should stop short at religion. It must go on and employ
                        itself on that subject too. An attachment to religion, therefore, implies
                        that that habit is not got. It does not imply that the mind may not in
                        detached places be capable of strong thinking. But it does imply that the
                        general habit does not exist. The habit of vigilant, indefatigable inquiry,
                        the habit of taking nothing upon trust, the habit of looking only to
                        evidence, as the sole ground of its belief, this is the habit of the strong
                        mind. And this is inconsistent with religion. Again, religion requires that
                        the mind should be governed by authority, that it should believe, not
                        because it sees reason to believe, after a fair and impartial examination of
                        evidence, but because it has been told that it is right to believe. If it
                        has looked at evidence, it has looked at that on one side only; and looked
                        with a disposition not to explore and detect, but a disposition to
                        acquiesce, and find <del>good</del> excellent. This is the habit of mental
                        partiality, mental unfairness. This is the habit which depraves the
                        judgement, makes men bad reasoners, both for speculation, and for
                        practice—Makes men bad husbands, bad fathers, bad judges, bad legislators,
                        bad every thing. This is the very source of injustice.—Strength of</p>

                    <p>mind consists in the vigilant habit of attending to evidence, and estimating
                        accurately its force. It is impossible the mind can totally divest itself of
                        this habit on one part of the field of thought, and retain it in others. In
                        order to be without it on the field of religion, the mind must take care to
                        be to a sufficient degree without it on other parts of the field of thought.
                        The <del>mind</del> inward is something like the <del>body</del> outward
                        frame, you cannot have a weak limb, without impairing the <del>general</del>
                        force of the whole body. If you cultivate, in religion, a habit, the very
                        reverse of that wherein strength of mind consists, you cannot but impair the
                        force of that habit. A habit is strong, exactly in proportion, as the
                        practice by which it is acquired is not only frequent, but uniform. If the
                        practice by which any habit is acquired is often broken <del>by habits</del>
                        and discontinued by practice of a contrary tendency, the habit is never
                        acquired in equal perfection. By this means two contrary habits must be
                        acquired at the same time, two habits inconsistent with one another—a habit
                        of attending to evidence, and a habit of not attending to it. Do you think
                        it possible for a man to have a confirmed habit of leaning upon others for
                        his opinions in religion, and not to have, on account of that habit, a
                        tendency to lean upon <del>others</del> them for <del>all his</del> other
                        opinions: To effeminate his mind in one thing, without affecting its
                        manliness in all? Is it possible for him to have all those habits on which
                        wrong thinking is founded, a lazy reliance on authority, an apprehension to
                        trust his reason, neglect and disregard of evidence, <del>looking</del>
                        hearing only one side, shutting his ears to the other; to have those habits
                        in perfection on the field of religion, and for those habits not to follow
                        him when he goes upon other parts of the field of thought? Is a practical
                        habit of the mind a thing which can be put off, or put on at pleasure? Is
                        this the nature of attention? Do not we endeavour to <del>prevent</del>
                        create in our children habits of attention, by preventing them from
                        contracting inattentive habits, in any department? Do we not tell them, that
                        they must not indulge in any awkward habits even by themselves, otherwise
                        they will be sure to practise them unwittingly when they come into company?
                        If a mind is capable of practising habitually the neglect of evidence, the
                        reliance on others, the fear to trust himself, the hearing of only one side,
                        the shutting of his ears to the other; can I form any other conclusion, than
                        that this man has no confirmed habits of looking to evidence, of trusting to
                        that only for his opinions, of accurately, and unintermittingly weighing
                        that, on all other subjects? What if some extraordinary men have given up
                        their reason on the <del>subjects, and cultivated</del> subject of religion,
                        yet possessed a powerful reason on others—as Locke, Hartley, Pascal, etc.?
                        Do a few individual exceptions overturn a general rule? To produce these
                        extraordinary cases, extraordinary, and now untraceable circumstances must
                        have operated. And as well might we say that education is of no use toward
                        making good plays, because Shakespeare made his without. The man whom Plato
                        reproved at dice, said he was meddling with but a trifle. A habit, said
                        Plato, is not a trifle. We do not let our children be cruel even to insects.
                        We do not let them tell lies even in play. We do not let them pilfer in
                        little things. <note>Diogenes Laertius, <emph>Lives of Eminent

                    <p>To believe there is any merit in believing is a thing wholly <del>impos</del>
                        immoral. If there is a merit in any thing, connected with belief, it is the
                        merit of attending to evidence, using all diligence in collecting evidence,
                        and all the attention and fairness of the mind, in ascertaining its value or
                        weight in the scale of proof. In this alone all virtue in believing is
                        included. But to take any set of opinions, and assign a merit to the having
                        of those opinions, a demerit to the not having them; to <del>hold out</del>
                        give out rewards for holding them, penalties for not holding them, is a
                        course directly opposed to that former <del>course</del> kind of merit, the
                        merit of attending solely to evidence. This is to hold out inducements to
                        turn away from evidence, for fear it should lead, not to the opinions to
                        which the rewards are attached, but to those to which the pains are
                        attached; to believe on account of the rewards without any regard to
                        evidence.—Again, to believe in the merit of belief, is really inconsistent
                        with toleration; and the higher the merit ascribed to belief, the more
                        intense must be the intolerance. Merit and demerit are relative
                        terms—exactly in proportion to the merit of belief, of course, is the
                        demerit of nonbelief. People of this belief are people of merit, people of
                        the correspondent disbelief are people of demerit. God Almighty is the
                        standard of perfection—he attaches a merit, he holds out rewards to the one,
                        inflicts evil upon the other. Is this example not to be followed? Is merit
                        not the proper object of love—demerit of hatred?—Further: Self-love is
                        intensely gratified, and fostered, by the same immoral course. If there is a
                        huge merit in said belief, <hi rend="underline">we</hi> have that merit,
                        because the belief is ours. If there is a huge demerit in said disbelief,
                        other men have that demerit, because that disbelief is theirs. The arrogant
                        assumption of merit in this line is more intense, perhaps, than in any
                        other—so intense, and so open, in any other line, it would not be
                        endured.</p>
                    <p>Suppose that there is one eye witness to a fact, and that a million of
                        persons repeat the statement after him: there is still but one witness to
                        the fact. And, suppose that one man examines the evidence of an opinion, and
                        finds it conclusive, after whom a million of people repeat the belief
                        without examination, there is still but one real witness to the truth of the
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>Not to believe what <del>is</del> we believe testified by God, is an

                        company of men,” says Chillingworth, “may oft-times follow a company of
                        beasts.” <emph>Ib.</emph>, Pref. to Author of C. M., § 12. The same author

                        believing a thing, which really may be testified by God, but which I cannot
                        know to be so, it may be no fault at all. I add, it may be virtue. Suppose
                        God to reveal to a man in India, without my knowing any thing about the

                        seems as much of necessity that mind, as that matter should have been
                        created; may it not, in the way in which they prove that it must have been
                        created, be proved that it could not be created? Suppose it uncreated, and
                        that nothing exists but the uncreated mind. This mind <del>proceeds</del>
                        wills to act; but whatever acts must have something to act upon; every agent
                        implies a patient, they are relative terms. But, by the supposition, this
                        mind has nothing to act upon. It is, therefore, impossible for it to act. If
                        matter had not been eternal, matter, it follows, could never have
                        existed.—Let us put all their suppositions, howsoever gratuitous. The
                        uncreated mind, if it acted at all, having nothing else to act upon, must
                        have acted upon itself. But how could matter be made out of mind? They seem
                        to be things of opposite natures. A[nd] if matter could be made out of mind,
                        could not mind be made out of matter? To solve this, they say, that matter
                        was made out of nothing. But this seems to be a contradiction in terms.
                        Nothing is a perfect negation not only of all existence, but of all
                        capability. <emph>Ex nihilo nihil fit.</emph> [Nothing can come from
                        nothing.] It seems quite as mysterious to me, that something should be made
                        out of nothing, as that something should begin to exist without a cause.</p>

                        ignorant, lest, knowing more, they should believe the less in them. These
                        are as far, nay, farther from the liberty and opportunities of a fair

                        where care is taken to propagate truth without knowledge, where men are
                        forced, at a venture, to be of the religion of the country, and must
                        therefore swallow down opinions, as silly people do empirics pills, without
                        knowing what they are made of, or how they will work, but believe that they
                        will do the cure; but in this are much more miserable than they, in that

                        implied in this word knowledge: the one is truth, the other evidence. First,
                        what is not truth can never be known: for let a man say he knoweth a thing
                        never so well, if the same shall afterwards appear false he is driven to
                        confession that it was not knowledge, but opinion. Secondly, if the truth be
                        not accompanied with its evidence, though a man holdeth it, yet is his
                        knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold the contrary.” Hobbes,
                            <emph>Hum. Nat.</emph>, ch. 6, § 2. Belief without evidence is therefore
                        not knowledge. Thus to believe in God is to be ignorant of God. To believe
                        without evidence is to be indifferent to truth.—“Evidence is to truth, as
                        the sap to the tree; which, so far as it creepeth along with body and
                        branches, keepeth them alive, where it forsaketh them, they die: for this
                        evidence, which is meaning with our words, is the life of truth.” Hobbes,

                        “When we believe any saying, whatsoever it be, to be true, from arguments
                        taken, not from the thing itself, or from the principles of natural reason,
                        but from the authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it;
                        then is the speaker, or person we believe in, or trust in, and whose word we
                        take, the object of our faith; and the honour done in believing, is done to
                        him only. And, consequently, when we believe that the scriptures are the
                        word of God, having no immediate revelation from God himself, our belief,
                        faith, and trust is in the church, whose word we take and acquiesce therein.
                        And they that believe that which a prophet relates unto them in the name of
                        God, take the word of the prophet, do honour to him, and in him trust and
                        believe, touching the truth of what he relateth, whether he be a true or a
                        false prophet. And so it is also with all other history. For if I should not
                        believe all that is written by historians of the glorious acts of Alexander
                        or Cæsar, I do not think the ghost of Alexander or Cæsar had any just cause
                        to be offended, or any body else, but the historian. If Livy say, the Gods
                        once made a cow speak, and we believe it not, we distrust not God therein,
                        but Livy. So that it is evident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other
                        reason than what is drawn from the authority of men only, and their
                        writings, whether they be sent from God or not, is faith in men only.”

                        some act of virtue to be a sin, in him it is a sin indeed. So, if you be
                        convinced, or rather, to speak properly, persuaded in conscience, that our
                        religion is erroneous, the profession of it, though in itself most true, to
                        you would be damnable. […] This I subscribe very willingly.”—According to
                        this decision, it may be a damnable sin, not to profess Atheism, even on the
                        supposition that God exists: For if any man is persuaded in conscience that
                        there is no evidence for the existence of a God, a profession that implied a

                        violence, instead of pity or persuasion, is such a strain of pride and
                        folly, as can scarce be accounted for from enthusiasm itself. I have read in
                        a Spanish author of a certain madman, who rambled about Spain with sword and
                        lance; and whomsoever he met with in his way, he required to acknowledge and
                        believe, that his mistress Dulcinea del Toboso was the handsomest woman in
                        the world. It was in vain for the other to reply, that he had no knowledge
                        at all of Dulcinea, or had a particular fancy to another woman; the madman
                        made no allowances for ignorance or prejudice, but instantly knocked him
                        down, and never left beating him till he promised to maintain the perfection
                        of the said lady above all her rivals. Such has been the conduct of many
                        priests, and priest-rid princes in prosecuting their <emph>spiritual
                            inclinations</emph>: each had his several Dulcinea, and resolved that
                        every body should admire her as much as himself: but as this was not easily
                        brought about, the controversy was determined by force of arms. Nay, though
                        it happened that all admired the same, they would even quarrel about the
                        fashion of his cloaths, and most bloody battles have been fought to decide
                        which colour became her best.” Lord Littleton, <emph>Pers. Lett.</emph>,

                        I am extremely touched by the zeal you have shown, and more moved than I can
                        say to you by the sentiments you have expressed to me.—There is much that is

                        published it as one of their principles, that no kind of war was lawful, and
                        which, being once published, they could not afterwards, however they might
                        change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more
                        prudent conduct in another sect among us; that of the Dunkers. I was
                        acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Weffare [Wohlfahrt], soon after
                        it appeared. He complained to me that they were grievously calumniated by
                        the zealots of other persuasions, and charged with abominable principles and
                        practices, to which they were utter strangers. I told him this had always
                        been the case with new sects, and that to put a stop to such abuse, I
                        imagined it might be well to publish the articles of their belief, and the
                        rules of their discipline. He said that it had been proposed among them, but
                        not agreed to, for this reason; ‘When we were first drawn together as a
                        society,’ said he, ‘it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to
                        see that some doctrines, which were esteemed truths, were errors; and that
                        others which we had esteemed errors were real truths. From time to time he
                        has been pleased to afford us further light, and our principles have been
                        improving, and our errors diminishing; now we are not sure that we are
                        arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual
                        or theological knowledge; and we fear that if we should once print our
                        confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confined by
                        it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement; and our
                        successors still more so, as conceiving what their elders and founders had
                        done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.’ This modesty in a
                        sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other
                        sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ
                        are so far in the wrong; like a man travelling in foggy weather; those at
                        some distance before him on the road he sees wrapt up in the fog, as well as
                        those behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side; but near
                        him all appear clear; though in truth he is as much in the fog as any of

                        to exterminate christianity from his state, the Jesuits had their martyrs
                        there like the other orders, and even had the greatest numbers. One will not
                        be surprised when one knows what was told to me by a man quite worthy of
                        trust. He had known very well a Jesuit who had been employed for twenty
                        years in Canada, and who did not believe in God as he admitted to my friend.
                        He had risked death twenty times for the religion which he had preached with
                        success to the savages. That friend pointed out to the Jesuit the
                        inconsistency of his zeal: Oh! replied the missionary, you have no idea of
                        the pleasure that one tastes in having twenty thousand men listening to you,
                        and in persuading them to believe what one does not believe in oneself.” [F]

                        virtue?—Quite so.—But is not Justice a human virtue? This too is
                        necessary.—It is necessary, therefore, as a consequence, that those among
                        human beings who are hurt, should become more unjust.—It appears so.—Can,

                        justice? Or, comprehensively speaking, can the good render others evil by
                        virtue?—No, it is impossible.—For it is not, methinks, the work of heat to
                        make any thing cold; but of the opposite.—Yes.—Nor of dryness to make any
                        thing wet, but of the opposite to dryness.—Wholly so.—Nor of the good, to do
                        hurt; but of the opposite to the good.—It appears so.—But the just is
                        good.—Assuredly so.—It is not the work of a just man, then, to hurt, O
                        Polemarchus, either a friend, or any one else, but of the opposite to the
                        just, of the unjust man.—What you say, O Socrates, is perfectly true.”

                        fairest side. Thus, the parson has the habit of viewing every thing which
                        composes the personal character only in the fairest light; the lawyer every
                        thing comprised in the lawyer character only in the fairest light; the

                    <p><emph>Grounds of Belief in a God.</emph> We see that certain things are done
                        by man, and would not be done without him. When we behold any such things
                        done we infer that man has done them. We therefore infer that the world
                        being something done, something like man did it. But all that man does is
                        only to alter; he makes nothing. The machine, called a watch, is not any
                        thing made. Every particle of it did exist, and would have continued to
                        exist without the man. The men only made the particular parts to exist in a
                        form and reason different from those which they would have taken of their
                        own accord. When we see a great house, or a watch, we not only conclude that
                            <del>men</del> chance did not make it, but that God did not make it.
                        Why? Because of experience—because we have always seen such things made by
                        men—not made in consequence of the laws of nature, the properties of things,
                        but by men constraining them. Not only do we know that things indicating
                        intellectual combinations were produced by men; if we see a Sir Reverence,
                        we know it has been produced by a man. Why? By the very same sort of
                        experience by which we know that the house was made by him. <note>Paley,

                        insults him, as a man who does not understand reasoning, because he does so.
                        Warburton fully admits Hume’s notion of a miracle, that it is a violation of
                        the established law of nature. Warburton, <emph>Remarks on Hume</emph>, v.
                        12, 353. Warburton does not distinguish between an objection to miracles,
                        and an objection to their proof. An objection to a miracle, is an absurdity
                        in terms. An objection to its proof, from its very essence, from which it
                            <del>shews that</del> it follows that it cannot be proved, is a
                        conclusive sort of reasoning, which Warburton could only deal with by

                        thing out of the mind? The thing in it. There is a thing in my mind; that
                        is, the thought. There is a thing out of it, that is the object. But how is
                        it the mind is connected with the thing out of it? By the thing within it.
                        But by the supposition, the thing in the mind, and the thing out of it, are
                        totally unlike. By the supposition also I can have no knowledge of the thing
                        out of the mind, but by the thing in it. But by that I know nothing of the
                        thing out of the mind, saving this, that it is totally unlike any thing
                        which I do know. If it be said, that I know its existence, what does that
                        mean? The existence of a thought I know. Is the existence of the object like
                        the existence of the thought? No. Then, the fact is, that the existence of
                        any thing out of the mind, is a word without an idea. <note>Thomas Reid,

                        relates, of course, to one of Mill’s projects to write a book clarifying

                        from either the evidence of the hand, or editions used. The hand would
                        indicate that it was put together in the late 1810s or early 1820s. The last
                        three pages (<ref target="cpb3ch9scrap221v">221v-223r</ref>) are definitely
                        in Mill’s post 1825 hand, and there is a pasted in item on <ref

                    <p>Some aspects of this section also reveal Mill’s interest in Bentham’s
                        projected religious writings; the gathering of material from Middleton,
                        Barrow, Taylor, etc., may have been for the purpose of averting a possible
                        legal suite upon their publication in the 1820s.</p>

                    <p>Interest operates in <del>many</del> two ways—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> with
                            consciousness—2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> without consciousness. In the first
                        case a man has his interest in his eye, and proposes it to himself as the
                        end of his action. In the second case, it is no less the end of the
                        action—but it is in some degree disguised. A man is often guided by views of
                        interest when he is not thinking of it. Interest first warps the
                        understanding—makes it embrace a set of opinions favourable to itself, which
                        as far as not just, are prejudices having interest for their father. By the
                        medium of these opinions a man goes on pursuing his own interest with
                        gluttony, all the while priding himself that he is only pursuing public
                        good. Self-deceit, the grand topic of the parsons, chiefly consists in
                        this.—See Butler’s Sermon on Self-deceit. The common state of a common man’s
                        mind is—to be ignorant of his own motives. He has no interest to find
                        them—rather disagreeable to reflect upon them. Much more interest to reflect
                        upon other people’s motives than one’s own. Whatever there is not flattering
                        in motives of another hurts not the inquirer—whatever there is
                        non-flattering in his own does. It thus happens not infrequently, that a man
                        not easily duped by others, is easily duped by himself. <note>“Upon
                            Self-deceit,” in Butler, <emph>Fifteen Sermons</emph>, n. 10, pp. 151-5:
                            “There is not any thing relating to men and characters, more surprising
                            and unaccountable, than this partiality to themselves, which is
                            observable in many; as there is nothing of more melancholy reflection,
                            respecting morality, virtue, and religion. Hence it is that many men
                            seem perfect strangers to their own characters. They think, and reason,
                            and judge quite differently upon any matter relating to themselves, from
                            what they do in cases of others where they are not interested. … {T}
                            here are instances of persons having so fixed and steady an eye upon
                            their own interest … as in a manner to regard nothing else … these
                            persons, without passing over the least, the most minute thing, which
                            can possibly be urged in favour of themselves, shall overlook entirely
                            the plainest and most obvious things on the other side. … their
                            deliberation concerning an action to be done … is not to see whether it
                            be right, but to find out reasons to justify or palliate it. … Thus a
                            man whose temper is formed to ambition or covetousness, shall even
                            approve of them sometimes in others.” See Mill’s use of this passage in
                            his article “Toleration,” <emph>Philanthropist</emph>, II (1812)

                    <p>A union of interests among those who profit by abuses. The application of
                        reason detects abuses—therefore they are afraid of the exercise of
                        reason—therefore they seek to decry it—therefore they use such fallacies as,

                            >experience, practicality</hi>, is for their purpose. Under blind
                        custom, the abuses by which they profit have grown up—therefore custom,
                        blind custom, alias experience, alias practice, alias wisdom of ancestors,
                        is an effectual defence. Keeping to things as they are—Keeping to the good,
                        you keep also to the bad. This is what the argument from blind custom aims
                        it [<emph>sic</emph> at]. To separate the bad from the good, is what reason
                        aims it [<emph>sic</emph> at]. Therefore it is the business of those who
                        find their advantage in the bad, to do what they can to decry reason—to
                        render the exercise of it odious—suspected.</p>

                        place to be distrusted. Answer. Surely it is the law of England, to distrust
                        every man, where he has any interest, however small, contrary to his duty.
                        If a first minister has a pecuniary interest of a shilling in a law suit,
                        the law refuses to hear him as a witness—to admit him as a juryman. Distrust
                        of the king himself is the very principle of the constitution. Hence,

                            then that it will be necessary for the speaker, by his eloquence, to put

                    <p>“That great lesson of morality, perhaps the only one that can have any
                        conspicuous influence on our actions, that we should ever carefully avoid
                        putting our interest in competition with our duty, or promise ourselves
                        felicity from the misfortunes of others; certain that in such circumstances,
                        however sincere our love of virtue may be, sooner or later it will give way,
                        and we shall imperceptibly become unjust and wicked in fact, however upright

                        is only that he will like his own interest better than his neighbour’s. And

                        unbelief, they cannot bear that you should take them for bad arguments; but
                        if at another time the same arguments are urged against them, they are

                    <p>How is it, do you think, that sinister interest works in the man who is

                        contrivances by which they may be represented as very trivial offences, at
                        any rate; by which (if that by any stretch can <del>be rendered</del> become
                        possible) they may be represented as not criminal in any degree. If any

                        mental process, than if he were honest enough to acknowledge to his own

                        he that is otherwise affected, and has not a travellers indifference (which
                        Epictetus requires in all that would find the truth), but much desires, in

                        than another, it is odds but he will take his desire that it should be, for
                        an assurance that it is so.—But I, for my part, unless I deceive myself,
                        was, and still am so affected as I have made profession: not willing, I

                        to support notions, that it is their interest to diffuse, and readily find
                        wit and spirit in a satire pointed at characters which they desire to

                            Wherein he can haply surpass himself.”</note></p>

                        passage above, that men praise those things in the praise of which is

                        is included any blame of themselves.</p>
                    <p><emph>Interest Governs Opinion.</emph> “Such is the power of interest over
                        almost every mind, that no one is long without arguments to prove any
                        position which is ardently wished to be true, or to justify any measures
                        which are justified by inclination.” Johnson, Dedication to the Female
                        Quixote. <note>(1732), in Johnson, <emph>Works</emph>, III 89.</note></p>
                    <p><emph>Men in Authority</emph> have an interest in opposing the progress of
                        mind. One of their modes and contrivances is, by diverting literature into
                        the field of mere imagination, and withdrawing it from the search of truth.
