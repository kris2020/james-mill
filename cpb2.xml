                <p>The contents of this volume have been slightly re-arranged to bring together
                    material on the same topic, most notably in the sections on <emph><ref
                            target="cpb2ch5">Religion</ref></emph>. As this volume is largely made
                    up of scraps, some with other notes by Mill or with letters to Mill on the
                    reverse, some of that matter has been transferred to the appropriate sections of
                        <emph>CPB</emph> V.</p>

                    <p>Given the fact that this section is a compilation of a large number of scraps
                        and notes, many of them written on the backs of letters or postmarked
                        covers, dating this material in terms of its time of writing is not
                        difficult. One word of caution should be issued about such dating. As paper
                        was, relatively speaking, rather expensive at this time, Mill obviously kept
                        larger scraps for future use. Note, for example, the notes on Hobbes’s
                        Leviathan, which are not in his hand, with the exception of the title added
                        at the bottom or the head of each piece. The first is postmarked 7/3/1810
                            (<ref target="cpb2ch1scrap27r">27r</ref>-<ref target="cpb2ch1scrap27v"
                            >27v</ref>), the second group in Law &amp; Law Reform (<ref
                            target="cpb2ch3scrap33v">33v</ref>), are on envelopes postmarked
                        6/2/1810 and 12/2/1810. Some later examples of continuous arguments are
                        written on scraps that can be dated several years apart. Unfortunately, it
                        is much more difficult to date the separate items from the nature of the
                        hand with small scraps; One needs a paragraph or more to make that type of
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>This section, noting the caveats mentioned above, can be fairly accurately
                        dated as coming for the most part from late in the 1810-1820 period. An
                        alternative title is undoubtedly <emph>Law of Libel</emph>. Mill
                        occasionally refers back to the sections in <emph>CPB</emph> I using that
                        title as well. The more general title has been chosen as he intermittently
                        raises the universal arguments relating to the foundations of this
                        subject.</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap1ra1"/>Gentlemen, I hope my appearance this day
                        before you to speak for myself, will not operate in the minds of any of you,
                        as a prejudice against me. It is not from any overweening <del>vanity that I
                            shall debate</del> desire of <del>making</del> shewing to the world what
                        I forsooth can atchieve in public speaking. I have all my life time, from a
                        natural timidity, shrunk from that kind of display, not because I condemned
                        it, but because my feelings required a different deportment. And assuredly,
                        gentlemen, if it had been any other kind of cause, if it had been a question
                        of <emph>meum</emph> and <emph>tuum</emph>, or of an imputed delinquency, of
                        any of the common sorts, I should have resorted to the approved and
                        practiced skill of the gentlemen of the bar, some of whom of the first
                        eminence would have been well disposed to have excited their splendid
                        talents in the cause of the friendship with which they honour me.</p>
                    <p>But this, gentlemen, is a peculiar offence. If any gentleman at the bar were
                        to exert himself faithfully against its punishment, all chance of success
                        promotion is gone for ever. Gentlemen, I felt that this [cause] was too
                        unsafe for which to draw upon my friends. And it would be too much to expect
                        fidelity from strangers upon such an occasion.</p>

                        press, proclaims aloud its conviction of its own rottenness. When they call
                        it good, they stand convicted of telling what they do not believe.
                        Castlereagh and Canning do not believe that the constitution is good.
                            <del>Why?</del> What is the proof? Because they desire to punish free
                        discussion about it. The archbishop of Canterbury don’t believe in the
                        bible; because he will not allow free discussion [of it]. He wishes to shut
                        up the passages of truth. These are two; free speaking, and free writing.
                            <note>In some places Mill has put an <hi rend="bold">X</hi> at the head
                            of a comment or quotation. These X’s seem to have been added after the
                            passage was written and to be a form of ‘NB’ for Mill in this section.
                            He also, however, uses X as ‘versus’ or ‘against.’</note></p>

                        writes contrary to morals.</p>
                    <p>I believe punishing even that is very useless. It may be left to the popular
                        sanction. It was so by the Romans. It is that which restrains it now. It is
                        pleasure in one alone of its shapes, that you now have any fear about. But
                        in the second place, there is a radical difference, between what people are
                        to believe, and what they are to do. Actions must be under restraint. Belief
                        not.</p>

                    <p>The most dangerous appetite of the people; the most dangerous tendency of the
                        press: is not towards calumny, but false praise of public men. “I am not
                        afraid,” said Burke, “of the liberty of the press; and I am not afraid of
                        the licentiousness of the press: but I own, I am afraid of its venality.”
                        See Mill’s <emph>India</emph>, iii, 113. <note><emph>The History of British
                                India</emph>, B. VI, c. 2. Mill quotes from Burke’s speeches in the

                        the contrary nothing is so dangerous to an office, as to identify it with
                        the vices of the men who are unworthy of it: And nothing is of so much
                        importance to the due veneration of the office, as to keep them rigidly
                        distinct. L’Estrange, Fab. 364. This, to be worked against those who cry,
                        you disparage law, and government, when you proclaim the vices of those who
                        wield the powers of either. <note>L’Estrange, <emph>Fables of Æsop</emph>,
                            p. 331, “A Priest and Epiphany,” in “Fables of Poggius”: “Moral: The
                            Silliness of the Person does not at all derogate from the Dignity of his
                            Character and Commission.”</note></p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap1rb5"/>“The lewdness of the person,” says
                        L’Estrange, Fab. 356, “does not at all derogate from the sacredness of the
                        function.” This is a common, and a just doctrine. How often is it said in
                        behalf of the clerical function, when we see a clergyman, by whom it is
                        disgraced? But if this be true, the converse is also true: And the
                        sacredness of the function ought not to screen the lewdness of the person.
                        But in so much as the making of good laws, and the exact execution of them,
                        are good things, by so much are they worthy of execration, who convert
                        legislation and judicature into instruments of mischief. <emph>Corruptio

                        express it by, “we may conclude, since the law of England as the lawyers
                        say, is the quintessence of reason,” that the restriction and bondage of the
                        press “was never any law, but an absurd and reasonless custom, begotten and
                        grown up from the servility of basest times, or the usurpation of immoderate

                        designed to punish, or not; which is in effect leaving to the magistrate to
                        punish or not to punish, at his pleasure, the individual who is brought
                        before him; which is just so much tyranny.” Paley’s <emph>Phil.</emph>, B.

                            9/1/1818. This was Bentham’s summer residence, c. 1813-19, where Mill
                            spent his summers, as well, until late 1818.</note></p>
                    <p>This is what Paley says. Wherever there is no precise definition, to give the
                        judge a power of punishing, is just so much tyranny. Gentlemen the case is
                        clear. There is no definition of libel. All punishment, as for libel, then,
                        is just so much tyranny.</p>
                    <p>If the offence can be defined, why is it not defined, by the only proper
                        authority, the legislature? And why do the judges presume to punish without
                        law? If you examine their reasons, gentlemen, you will find it amounts
                        exactly to this: We go on punishing, because our predecessors have
                        punishment [<emph>sic</emph> punished it]. But, gentlemen, it is no reason,
                        because a thing has been done, that it ought to be done. Clearly, if any
                        thing is to be considered as an act fit for punishment, it ought to be made
                        so by law. Till it is made so by the legislature it cannot be really and
                        truly a law, and to punish by it, is tyranny, according to Paley.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I will bring the matter to a short conclusion. Either it is
                        capable of definition, or it is not. If it is capable of definition, clearly
                        the legislature ought to define it, and there ought to be no punishment upon
                        it, till it is defined.</p>
                    <p>If it cannot be defined, hear what Paley says, who speaks the language of
                        reason and justice. He says that all acts which cannot be defined, are unfit
                        for punishment; and ought to be left to that powerful restraint which [is]
                        constituted by the sentiments of mankind. He says, gentlemen, that this is a
                        general principle which runs through all human laws. His words are, “Human
                        Laws permit, or, what is the same thing, suffer to go unpunished, many
                        crimes.”—Why, gentlemen? Mark the reason: “because they are incapable of
                        being defined by any previous description.” Paley goes on, “Where,
                        therefore, […] the distinction between right and wrong is of too subtle or
                        of too secret a nature to be ascertained by any preconcerted language, the
                        law of most countries, especially of free states, rather than commit the
                        liberty of the subject to the discretion of the magistrate, leaves men in
                        such cases to themselves.” <emph>Ib.</emph>

                    <p>I know, gentlemen, what the lawyers will say. They will not be able to shew,
                        gentlemen, that one word is incorrect. But they will not be without a
                        resource. They will assert it, without being able to shew. And they will
                        endeavour to make their assertions carry to your minds the appearance of
                        proof. You will need, therefore, to be very much on your guard. If you are
                        not a little practiced in distinguishing assertions for proofs, you will be
                        very apt to be deceived. Their mode, gentlemen, is very misleading. They
                        will make a bold assertion, that all I have said <anchor
                            xml:id="cpb2scrap1vb"/><del>it is not. If it is capable</del> is
                        incorrect, discordant with the law. Well, gentlemen, when you have heard
                        this assertion of theirs, you expect the proof, and listen for that purpose.
                        Well, the lawyers will run on, with a quantity of talk, as if they were
                        giving you proof; and if you are not very attentive, you will be apt to
                        receive it as such. But if you look to it closely, you will find it is any
                        thing in the world rather than proof. You will find, it is either a parcel
                        of words without meaning, so contrived as to have the semblance of meaning
                        but none of the substance. Or you will find that it is language, not
                        calculated to open up to you the subject, but to render you inattentive, and
                        draw you away from it. They know they dare not deny, that libel is without a
                        definition, therefore without a law. They will not dare openly to meet the
                        assertion that to punish without a definition, is not essentially arbitrary
                        and tyrannical. They will not before you gentlemen dare to me face to face
                        upon that ground. This, however, you clearly see is what they ought to do,
                        if they wish the point which ought to guide your judgements to be really
                        determined.</p>
                    <p>They will not do this. But I know, gentlemen, what they will do. And it is of
                        great importance to both of us, that I should tell it to you. They will tell
                        you, gentlemen, that a great part of the law of this country is no better
                        defined than the law of libel. But, reason guide us, gentlemen! What sort of
                        an apology is this! You point out one thing which ought not to be done; you
                        prove clearly before the tribunal of reason and justice, that it ought not
                        to be done. And they point out to you a multitude of other things which
                        ought not to be done. Gentlemen, this is to mock you, not to reason before
                        you. Is this the way to enlighten your understandings? But, gentlemen, the
                        lawyers will be very confident, for they are accustomed to succeed in this
                        very way. And they will be exceedingly enraged at me for endeavouring to put
                        you on your guard. They will, therefore, do two things, which they are
                        accustomed to find very well adapted to their purposes. They will run out
                        into a violent praise of the law; and will then, cry, will you gentlemen,
                        believe that this excellent law would have so great a portion of itself
                        undefined, if want of definition were a bad thing? Gentlemen, I wish you to
                        mark this point very carefully, and to fix as clear a conception of it as
                        possible in your minds. If you do fix a clear conception of it, gentlemen,
                        in your minds, and compare it attentively with what they say, you will find
                        it contains the whole sum and substance of their artifice.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I am ready to contend with the lawyers upon this ground, and
                        desire no better arbiters between us than you. You shall not, gentlemen, be
                        allowed to be deceived by vague talk in praise of the laws. Let us,
                        gentlemen, if we mean to act wisely, distinguish between what really
                        deserves praise in the laws, and what does not deserve praise. Gentlemen,
                        you</p>

                        included under the term philosophy, there is one which is denominated Logic.
                        The end of logic is, to examine all the possible sorts of argument; and to
                        give us a list of those which are good, and lead to the truth, those which
                        are fallacious, or deceitful, because they mislead from the truth.
                        Gentlemen, among these fallacious and deceitful arguments which they call
                        sophisms, the philosophers in question, the logicians, have ranked the
                        following, and have placed it very high in the list: When [an] arguer takes
                        hold of something which is very good in the whole, and endeavours to make it
                        appear that because it is good upon the whole, therefore, every [thing]
                        which is about it is good. As if, gentlemen, any arguer should point out a
                        man of great honour and virtue, and should bestow upon him all the honour he
                        merits, and should then infer that common swearing, for example, is no vice,
                        because that great and good man is a swearer. The same false reasoning,
                        gentlemen, you must clearly see that it is, to tell us that the English laws
                        are good upon the whole, to tell it in all the swelling phrases which they
                        can rake together, and from that endeavour to persuade us, that it is not a
                        vice in laws to be without definition.</p>
                    <p>I willingly acknowledge, gentlemen, that there is far too much of the law of
                        England, every thing is too much, without definition. Is that any reason,
                        why the offending acts of the press [should be] without definition? Is that
                        any reason, gentlemen, why [we] should proceed to inflict a punishment,
                        where the legislature has not said there is a crime? (Mackintosh, Speech for
                        Peltier, p. 89, abuses those who call for a definition of libel.) <note>J.G.

                            slowly built up the fabric of our laws never attempted any thing so
                            absurd as to define by any precise rule the obscure and shifting
                            boundaries which divide libel from history or discussion.”</note></p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I say, and before the tribunal of reason, and according to the law
                        of public good, I know that I can maintain, that wheresoever in the field of
                        law, there is no definition, whatever the extent, there ought to be nothing
                        which bears the shape of <del>what is properly</del> execution of law,
                        except, gentlemen, in those cases in which evil would accrue in the interval
                        before the time when the legislature could possibly supply definition. These
                        are all the cases in which existing rights might be violated. Whatever
                        operations hitherto employed under the misapplied name of execution of the
                        law, where no law existed, are necessary to preserve those rights
                        unimpaired, till the legislature have time to apply a definition should be
                        intermediately applied. But gentlemen, when this is done to ban immediate
                        mischief, nothing else should be done. Now you will observe gentlemen, that
                        the case of libel does not fall under that class I have just been
                        mentioning. As there is no law, therefore, there should be nothing in the
                        shape of execution. No existing rights are capable of being shifted by that
                        means. No harm can arise by refusing to punish a man without law for using
                        the press as I have done, till the legislature tells both you and me what is
                        right, and what is wrong.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap2rb2"/>Gentlemen, I cannot sufficiently express the
                        gratitude I feel, for the patience with which you have heard me, and the
                        close attention you have bestowed upon the reasons, gentlemen, which I have
                        endeavoured to present to your minds, and which I cannot help being cheered

                    <p>One thing more, gentlemen, and one thing only I have yet to say; and I hope
                        you will bear with me, if I call upon you, it will not detain you long, to
                        favour me with a peculiar portion of your attention. It is a matter of first
                        rate importance both to you and to me. Hear me, gentlemen. Whatsoever I have
                        said gentlemen respecting lawyers, in general, and their appetite for
                        condemnation in the free use of the press, every thing I have said of my
                        accusers, and of the arts against which I have endeavoured to guard you, I
                        have meant it equally of the judge whom you will find to act and speak as my
                        eager accuser.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I have done. Your lordship need not interrupt me. You shall now
                        have it all.</p>
                    <p>And gentlemen, May that infinite justice which views us all, and that reason
                        of which a portion is imparted to you, give to you to form such a judgement
                        as will give satisfaction to your own souls, when you will have heretofore
                            [<emph>sic</emph> hereafter] to meet me face to face, before a far other

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap2va3"/>Paley introduces a very good rule. It is upon
                        the occasion of drunkenness; the doubt in what degree intoxication is the
                        excuse for a crime. Paley says very properly, that as the man is not a moral
                        agent under intoxication, and you must go back to the moment when he was not
                        intoxicated, his moral guilt is proportional to the probability there was,
                        that his intoxication would lead to such a crime. See Paley’s <emph>Mor.

                    <p>Apply this rule to libel. Estimate the probability of evil from this writing
                        at the moment of my writing. Clearly, gentlemen, no probability at all. They
                        say, Oh yes, there was the certainty of violating the law. Gentlemen two
                        answers, and most satisfactory apply to this seeming objection. In the first
                        place, gentlemen, I saw that the law, if we must call it a law, was violated
                        by every body, violated by the judges themselves, violated every day—that it
                        if it was not violated, society could not go on as it does—that it was
                        meritorious, therefore, to violate it <del>at least</del> in many
                        instances—This being the case, gentlemen, I was sure it was meritorious to
                        violate it in this instance. The second irrefragable argument, gentlemen,
                        with which I have to answer their allegation that I have violated the law,
                        is a flat denial. I have violated no law. I affirm, gentlemen, that I have
                        violated no law. If I have let them point it out.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap2vb4"/>Gentlemen, I have to tell you, what the sense
                        of justice, common to mankind, has recommended to the most enlightened
                        nations, in the case of a judicatory composed like you, of a number of
                        judges. It is sanctioned by the civil and Roman [law], the groundwork of the
                        laws of all the nations of Europe, as a fixed rule, and a peremptory
                        ordinance, that where the voices are divided, the sentence should coincide
                        with the opinion of those who are most favourable to the prisoner. And in
                        estimating the amount of the punishment, the opinion of those who make it
                        the lightest, is the opinion to which the verdict should conform. “What has

                    <p>The following is one point.</p>
                    <p>“The first maxim of a free state is, that the laws be made by one set of men,
                        and administered by another; in other words that the legislative and
                        judicial characters be kept separate […]—For the sake of illustration, let
                        it be supposed, […] that the courts of Westminster hall made their own laws;
                        […] it is evident, in the first place, that the decisions of such a
                        judicature would be so many laws; and, in the second place, that when the
                        parties and the interests to be affected by the law were known,” (observe
                        gentlemen, what follows) “the inclinations of the lawmakers would inevitably
                        attach on one side or the other; and that, where there was neither any fixed
                        rules to regulate their determinations, nor any superior power to controul
                        their proceedings, these inclinations would interfere with the integrity of
                        public justice. The consequence of which must be that the subjects of such a
                        constitution would live either without any constant laws, that is, without
                        any known pre-established rules of adjudication whatever; or under laws made

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap3rb6"/>Paley ascribes the following qualities to the
                        laws of England, as qualities indispensably requisite to a

                        bestow upon them. <emph>Mor. Phil.</emph>, B. VI, ch. 7.</p>
                    <p>“In the infliction of punishment, the power of the crown, and of the
                        magistrate appointed by the crown, is confined by the most precise
                        limitations.” This is the first property gentlemen, we shall presently
                        compare it with their pretended law of libel. “The guilt of the offender
                        must be pronounced by 12 men of his own order, <hi rend="underline"
                            >indifferently</hi> chosen out of the county where the offence was
                        committed.” This is Paley’s second [con]dition of a righteous judgement. We
                        sh[all] presently compare it with their pret[ended] law of libel. “The
                        punishment or the limits to which the punishment may be extended, are
                        ascertained and affixed to the crime by laws which knew not the person of
                        the criminal.” This is the third gentlemen. This too we must examine. Paley
                        goes on, “And whereas arbitrary confinement […] is the injury most to be
                        dreaded from the strong hand of the executive government because it deprives
                        the prisoner at once of protection and defence, and delivers him into the
                        power, and to the malicious or interested designs of his enemies.” etc. This
                        too gentlemen you must see in comparison with their law of libel.

                        agreeable to the spirit, but that it is an explicit, and well know principle
                        of the law of England, that the employment of language, in the most general
                        acceptation of the word language, to the disadvantage of another person,
                        where good is to be derived from that use of it, is right and legal.—

                    <p>Observe, gentlemen; the master who gives an unfavourable character of a
                        servant, does exactly what the lawyers say, constitutes the essence of a
                        libel. He does, <emph>ipso facto</emph>, libel that servant. I defy them to
                        shew me wherein the act differs from their definition of a libel. Well,
                        then, gentlemen, what do the lawyers do in this case? Do they say you must
                        not give an unfavourable character? No—they say, directly the contrary. They
                        say you may give an unfavourable character. But why, we ask them—will it not
                        be a libel? No, they tell us it will not—and the reason is—gentlemen, mark
                        well the reason; it is a legitimate, a full <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap3v2"
                        />and perfect reason—it is not a libel because this freedom, however hurtful
                        to the individual, is good for the community. This, gentlemen, is
                        admirable—here then we have a rule—a rule, of the lawyers, in which we
                        cannot too confidently build. The rule, gentlemen, is, that wherever the
                        good of the community is served by freedom of speech, that freedom is legal,
                        however hurtful to the individual against whom it is applied. But Oh,
                        gentlemen, what a difference between the case in which the lawyers allow
                        this freedom, and that in which they do not allow it. Where they do allow it
                        the advantage is insignificant compared with that in which they do not allow
                        it—work the difference.</p>
                    <p>But is this the only case, gentlemen, in which this rule of law is
                        established? Not so, indeed. Take next the case of the pleading lawyer.
                        There is no imputation so gross, but what he may throw out; against any
                        person whatsoever. Here, too, there is every thing to constitute a libel,
                        and a libel, of the <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap3v3"/>most hurtful description.
                        There is the greatest degree of publicity; and there is a high degree of
                        authority. This involves in it that which they define as the essence of
                        libel; and that in its most concentrated and forcible state. It is of all
                        libels one from which the libelled individual is likely to suffer the most.
                        Yet this again the lawyers say, is a good, and laudable use of the freedom
                        of speech. On what ground, gentlemen, for what reason? The same, exactly as
                        before, a just and proper reason. This <del>freedom was</del> power of
                        casting the most injurious reflections, cannot be refused to the lawyer,
                        without the sacrifice of much advantage to the community. Here, gentlemen,
                        is another great and striking confirmation of the same rule—the rule, that
                        where freedom leads to public good, there freedom is legal, even where its
                        application is individually the most hurtful.—Here, again, gentlemen,
                        compare the good which would be sacrificed by refusing this freedom to the
                        lawyer—with the good which would be sacrificed by refusing it to the
                        press.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap3v4"/>Gentlemen, what is yet more remarkable is—that
                        even the unjust use of this freedom, the giving a false character of a
                        servant; the casting false imputations, in the course of a pleading, is not
                        an offence according to the English law. All that is necessary, in the case
                        of the servant is, that the master speak <emph>bona fide</emph> and without
                        malice— in the case of the lawyer even this is not necessary, he may cast
                        imputations which he knows to be false, and still he is safe, provided they
                        are relevant, or bear upon his point. See for this doctrine, the opinion of
                        the judges, in the case of the prosecution of Scarlet for defamatory words,
                        in Serjeant’s Hall, Jan. 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> 1818, reported in the

                    <p>Gentlemen, it is legal for me to say, that charges have been given to juries
                        by judges in this country, which charges were not according to law. No

                    <p>Now, gentlemen, I take upon me to affirm that nine out of ten of all the
                        charges that ever have been given by judges in this country to juries in the
                        case of libel, have not been according to law. <note>“Serjeant’s Inn Hall,

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap4ra1"/>Gentlemen, the plan I shall follow is
                        this</p>
                    <p>1. I shall first talk to you about the law. (Here present a list of their
                        definitions. Shew that the executing of such a law, completely and
                        consistently, would be intolerable. It would put almost every man in the
                        country in a prison. Next, Shew their expedient: which is, to leave the law
                        unexecuted in all cases generally but those which particularly affect the
                        sinister interests of some public men; that it is, by consequence left
                        unexecuted in a number of cases, out of all proportion greater than those in
                        which it is executed. And then shew that such a law is altogether unfit for
                        execution.)</p>
                    <p>2. I shall talk to you about the general rule of reason, applicable to this
                        case.</p>
                    <p>3. I will refute the allegations of my accusers.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I shall keep to this ground. You shall be my judges, that I do.
                        And I here lay it down, that you may see it is a ground over which I have a
                        right to tread—and that it may stand as some sort of defence to me against
                        those interruptions which there are persons in this court will be so
                        desirous of distressing me with—and that if I do meet with them,
                        notwithstanding, you, gentlemen, may be prepared to judge of them, as they
                        deserve.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap4ra2"/>Having shewn that the general rule which they
                        pretend to lay down for libel, is never so much as thought of being
                        executed, in by far the greatest number of the cases in which it is
                        violated; executed only in a comparatively small number— <del>where men of
                            power have a part</del> I have now to shew that a law which is placed in
                        this situation; a law which is moulded by custom into this particular shape,
                        and operating in this particular manner, is a law altogether unfit for
                        execution.</p>
                    <p>I mean to use the opinion of a man, whose opinion is free from all ground of
                        cavil. Dr. Paley says, “If, of two actions perfectly similar, one be
                        punished, and the other be rewarded or forgiven,” which I have shewn you to
                        be the case, in this pretended law of libel: What then? Gentlemen! What in
                        the opinion of Paley is the consequence? “The subjects,” he says, “of such a
                        dispensation would no longer know, either what to expect, or how to act. <hi
                            rend="underline">Rewards and punishments would cease to be
                        such</hi>—would become <hi rend="bold">accidents</hi>. … An attention to
                        general rules, therefore, is included in the very idea of reward and
                        punishment.” <emph>Mor. Phil.</emph>, B. II, ch. 7. Of course when the
                        general rule is not attended, that is not executed, once in ten times, all
                        punishment is improper.</p>
                    <p>To make a rule, such as that upheld by judges for the liberty of the press, a
                        rule unfit to be acted upon in 99 cases out of a hundred—to leave it
                        unexecuted in 99 cases out of 100—and leave it in the <del>power</del>
                        choice of the Attorney General, i.e., of his masters, to select the cases,
                        is plainly to establish the most cruel kind of tyranny over the press.</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap4rb4"/>Gentlemen, I am a member of the public. I am
                        prepared to assert, and to sacrifice my life in asserting the right and the
                        duty, as a member of the public, of declaring and supporting by argument my
                        opinions on the affairs of that public, of which I am a constituent member,
                        and whose affairs are, therefore, my affairs. Gentlemen, every idea of
                        freedom of action must be renounced, if this is denied—if this power is not
                        enjoyed in its most unlimited shape. If in the exercise of this power I do
                        any harm, prove it. Shew the fact. Do not doom me upon constructions; that
                        is, lawyer’s subtleties, and lawyer’s falsehoods. Open the book of the law,
                        and shew me the enactment I have violated. In the exercise of this, as of
                        any other power I may do mischief. I may excite to plunder. I may excite to
                        murder. If so, read the law, prove the fact, and punish. To what illegal act
                        have I incited? What law have I broken? None gentlemen; absolutely none. The
                        lawyers, when they talk to you will affirm that I have. But gentlemen it is
                        your duty, to trust, not to what they say, but what they prove. How will you
                        satisfy the justice which you owe to me, or to your country, if you decided
                        against me upon what lawyers say, but are unable to prove? <note>On a scrap

                        English constitution, it is for the preservation of the constitution, [that]
                        they are so eager to circumscribe the liberty of the press.</p>
                    <p>Why gentlemen, the course they are pursuing is the very way to destroy the
                        constitution of England. Let them reduce the press to that state of slavery
                        to which their system of conduct would reduce it, and one vestige of the
                        constitution would not be in existence 20 years.</p>
                    <p>What is it that has made the constitution of England to be what it is? What,
                        gentlemen, but the liberty of the press? What but such a liberty, gentlemen,
                        as judges and lawyers have at all times used their utmost endeavours to
                        destroy? What, gentlemen, but such a liberty, as in every step of it, is a
                        violation, a strong, and flagrant violation, of that law which they, by
                        their sole authority, have set up; and which they insist upon executing, as
                        the law of the land, though it is in fact nothing but their arbitrary
                        will.</p>
                    <p>Sir, the greater part of the law of this country, upon which the lives and
                        property of the people depend, is in the state which you presume to
                        condemn.</p>
                    <p>More’s the pity, my lord, that so great a portion of the rule of action
                        should be in a state so little worthy of trust.</p>
                    <p>Sir, I won’t sit to hear the law abused.</p>
                    <p>Quiet your spirit, my lord, there is nobody here [who] wants to abuse the
                        law. For the law, my lord, if you are pleased to speak of it in the
                        abstract, I have a thousand times greater reverence than your lordship, for
                        I wish it perfect, your lordship the reverse, to cover it with jewels, my
                        lord; you with rags and vermin. But mark what I say my lord. The explanation
                        of that part of the law which affects my case, is part of the instruction
                        which ought to go to the jury. Every thing which is requisite for the full
                        explanation of the law, I owe is, instruction, my lord, to be sent to the
                        jury. Every thing, my lord, which is calculated to let them see the nature
                        and qualities of the law, is instruction fit to be given to the jury. The
                        Attorney General has inveighed upon the consequences of letting my act go
                        unpunished. I am entitled to shew the jury what would be the consequence of
                        punishing it. Not the bare words of the law, my lord, and here is a law
                        without words, but all the material adjuncts of the law, are to be recalled
                        to the minds of the jury. Of a law which has no words, my lord, as is the
                        case with this law, the knowledge my lord, exists, if it ever be said to
                        exist at all, in the adjuncts, and nothing but the adjuncts.</p>
                    <p>To return to the subject, I will now proceed to shew to the jury by a
                        satisfactory induction, that all the writings to which the constitution and
                        people of England owe the most, have been violations of the law of
                        libel.</p>

                        of the Liturgy, etc., (<emph>Morning Chronicle</emph>, 19th-20th Dec. 1817)
                        the judges endeavoured to prevent him from adducing instances to shew, that
                        parodies of the bible and prayer book had been often published with
                        impunity. Their dictum was, if other people have done amiss, that cannot
                        justify you. True, gentlemen. But if other people have not been punished,
                        for that for which they seek to punish me, where is the equal dealing? If
                        there is a certain act which other people have not been punished for—people
                        of the highest character and worth; it is a fair presumption that the act is
                        innocent, and that nobody ought to be punished for it. The act they say, is
                        forbidden by the law, and then they run out into expression of affected
                        horror at the breaking of the law. Gentlemen, we have all heard of laws
                        “more honoured in the breach than the observance.” Whether this law falls
                        under that important distinction, I will not at present argue. But there is
                        another point, gentlemen, to which I earnestly beg to call your attention.
                        There is such a thing, gentlemen, as a law falling into desuetude; being
                        abrogated by non-execution; in such a manner that it would be as unjust to
                        punish a man upon it, as upon a law repealed by the legislature. In a
                        country in which custom makes laws, as it does in this country, it is still
                        more proper that it should unmake them. Now gentlemen, this is what I
                        maintain; that when a greater number of cases can be produced in which the
                        law is not executed, than of those in which it is, every man has a right to
                        protest against being punished under that law. The mode in which the law is
                        executed constitutes part of the law. If the law in certain respects is not
                        executed, every instance of non-execution, creates a right in every man to
                        expect, that he shall be treated no worse than others who have gone before
                        him. The law is made, the common law is made, right or wrong I do not now
                        dispute, by custom and the decisions of judges. Is not every instance in
                        which a law is not executed so much of a custom; is not every such instance
                        a <del>decision of the law authorities</del> in which the law authorities
                        have not thought proper to execute it, a species of decision by these law
                        authorities against it? This, therefore, gentlemen, I contend to be a law of
                        nature which nothing but violence and injustice can infringe; that when the
                        bulk of other men are not punished for the violation of any law, neither
                        ought any individual, without a new promulgation of the law, and an
                        assurance that it will be executed impartially. Therefore gentlemen, it is
                        of vast importance for you to know how the law has heretofore been executed.
                        What can the judge mean by seeking to deprive you of that knowledge?

                    <p>Under any law, gentlemen, be it what it will, any one man has a right to
                        demand, not to be worse treated than other men. Only suppose a law to be
                        made, such as bad rulers may chuse. Let it be free for them to leave it
                        unexecuted as often as they please, and then to do as this judge does, when
                        they meet with a man whom they wish to strike by it, tell him, that it is no
                        reason why he should go free, because other men have been left free, and is
                        any thing else necessary to make law worse than no law—give wicked rulers a
                        power of doing what they please, under a mischievous colour of law?</p>
                    <p>No reason to go free, because others have gone free! But by heaven it is. If
                        in justice, and the good of the human race, there is any reason to be
                        found.</p>

                        anger, mentions language, denying the possession of good qualities, in
                        general, but more especially those good qualities, on which the dignity,
                        real or supported [<emph>sic</emph> supposed] of the party, depends—adds an
                        important fact: That such language hurts, only when the party does not
                        possess the quality detracted from him, or possesses it in a much less
                        degree, or is supposed to possess it in a much less degree, than he wishes
                        to be thought to possess it. “But they are far more angry if they suspect
                        that they do not possess these qualities, either not at all, or not to any
                        great extent, or when others do not think they possess them. For when they
                        feel strongly that they do possess these qualities which are the subject of
                        mockery, they pay no heed to it.” [G] Arist., Rhet., l. II, c. 2, § 16.

                        shunned, a person from whom every thing which is bad and infamous, rather
                        than any thing which is good and honourable, may naturally be expected.
                        Gentlemen of the jury, would you willingly stamp these impressions upon the

                        them—to stamp with the impression of not deserving respect, a man <del>whom
                            you believe</del> who in your opinion does deserve it, a man who you
                        cannot believe does not deserve it, etc.</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap5ra1"/>Gentlemen, the existence of a law is
                        inseparable from words. A law without words is nothing at all.</p>
                    <p>Next, gentlemen of the jury, the decision of a judge is not a law. The
                        business of a judge, gentlemen, you well know. It is to pass judgement upon
                        an individual case, when it is brought before him; that is, to declare under
                        what existing law the case is included. This sentence, gentlemen, is not
                        law. When the judge pronounces that my lord this, or Mr. that, has been
                        guilty of treason, what he says is not the law. If he quotes the law, he
                        quotes other people’s words, and we know where to find them.</p>
                    <p>Now, gentlemen, what I wish you to do is, to ask the Attorney General for the
                        words of the law upon which he desires you to consent to my punishment. You
                        are judges of the law, insist then upon seeing the words of the law. Nothing
                        is a law but words. Compell them to shew you the words. Your conscience
                        requires it gentlemen. Your oath is to pass according to the law—Desire to
                        see the law, otherwise how can you pass? Do not allow them to cheat you, or
                        to frighten you, with imperious talk. You are Englishmen, and have the manly
                        English heart in you. If they bellow ever so stoutly, this act of mine is a
                        violation of the law of the press, all they can mean is included in some
                        prohibitory law. And if that law exists, it must have words. Let them shew
                        the words. Etc., etc., etc.</p>

                        making, under the pretence of declaring, common law) “here have been, not
                        the representatives of our choice, but the servile instruments of our
                        monarchs—at one time, the great delinquents who presided in our tribunals in
                        the days of Richard II—and at another, the corrupt judges of the Jameses and
                        Charleses, who suffered themselves to be practiced upon by the King’s law
                        officers, and met in secret cabals to decide the fate of the victims of the
                        crown, before any accusation was openly preferred against them;—the men who,
                        by their abject obedience to the dictates of their master, when they were
                        his hired advocates, and by the keenness with which, as his blood hounds,
                        they hunted down the prey he had marked out, had sufficiently proved how
                        well disposed they were to do him good service in the high and sacred office
                        of a judge.”</p>
                    <p>Per this lawyer the law officers of the crown are the blood hounds, who hunt
                        down the prey, which kings and ministers mark out to them—and by their
                        abject compliance in this capacity, shew the services they are fit for, when
                        raised to the situation of judges.</p>

                        misconduct, on the part of the public at large, is not only an indispensable
                        security for good judicature, but it is a true, an essential, and
                        acknowledged part of English law. It is an essential part of English law,
                        that the courts of justice should be open—and the business performed in
                        public—For what end? Hear Paley, who having stated this publicity, as one of
                        the most indispensable securities for the righteous administration of
                        justice, concludes his illustration, thus! “The most corrupt judge will fear
                        to indulge his dishonest wishes, in the presence of such an assembly: he
                        must encounter what few can support, the censure of his equals and
                        companions, together with the indignation and reproaches of his country.”
                        Paley puts the whole stress, we see, upon the salutary influence, not of
                        being protected from censure, but standing completely exposed to it. Paley,

                        possibility of secret management, and undue practices: Or, in contests
                        between the crown and the subject, the judge, appointed by the crown, may be
                        suspected of partiality to his patron; or of entertaining inclinations,
                        favourable to the authority from which he derives his own. … The jury, by
                        their disinterestedness, check any corrupt partialities which previous
                        application may have produced in the judge.”</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap5vb8"/>“We come to consider whether the reading of
                        the scriptures be the cause of all the sects and fanaticisms which have been
                        in England? He might much better have charged the Philosophers, especially
                        Aristotle, with all the disputes in the world; for they not only by their
                        writings have occasioned many, but have taught men the pernicious use of
                        reasoning, without which the world might be as quiet as a flock of sheep. If
                        they could but persuade men to lay aside that mischievous faculty, I dare
                        undertake for them, that let the people have the bible never so much among
                        them, they shall never hurt the church of Rome. Do they not tell us, that
                        the words of scripture are plain for transubstantiation; ‘This is my body.’
                        Why, then, do not the people as readily believe that as any other
                        proposition? By which we see, it is not merely reading, but a more dangerous
                        thing, called <hi rend="underline">considering</hi> or <hi rend="underline"
                            >reasoning</hi>, which makes them embrace some things as they lie in
                        words; and interpret others according to the clearest evidence which the
                        nature of the thing, the comparing with other places, and the common sense
                        of mankind, will give—But why are we not all of a mind? I would fain know
                        the time when men were so. This variety of sects was objected against the
                        philosophers, and thought no argument then. It was objected against the
                        primitive christians, and thought of no force then. Why must it signify more

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap6r1"/>Gentlemen, I appear before you, unaccustomed
                        as I am to public speaking, and unqualified for doing it well, because I
                        tell you plainly, I know no lawyer, whom I could have expected to do me
                        justice, and therefore I determine[d] rather to defend myself though weakly,
                        than by another man unfaithfully. As law and lawyers are situated in our
                        country, gentlemen, they are all the natural enemies of a man in my
                        situation, and as much as they can, under a certain kind of disguise, they
                        will labour to destroy him. That I may not, however, convey an impression
                        which I do not wish of a body of men, many of whom as men, are both amiable
                        and honourable, it is requisite I should in a few words explain what I mean.
                        It is shortly this gentlemen. The study and occupation of my life, you see,
                        is, to let in light upon the craft of state. Now only think what interest
                        these lawyers have that light should not be let in upon that out of which
                        they derive such oceans of wealth and mountains of power. Think, gentlemen,
                        that if the law were good, little or nothing would be made of it by the
                        lawyers. Only think, gentlemen, that if our institutions were purified, as I
                        desire to purify them, ministers would not have so many rich things, rich
                        places, high titles, with which to tempt the whole race of lawyers, and make
                        them, by their expectations, dependents upon his favours, <del>fortune</del>
                        and ever ready to join with him in crushing those men, who <del>have the
                            virtue to endeavour</del> make others acquainted with the vicious acts
                        which are done, and the causes from which they proceed. You see then,
                        gentlemen, how the matter stands. You see that beside the badness of their
                        own system, out of which they derive all; they have before their eyes all
                        the good things which a minister can bestow, judgeships and peerages if they
                        are not judges, emoluments without limit to themselves, and their brood, if
                        they are judges already; all these things dancing on the field of hope, if
                        they <del>should rage</del> shew enmity more open or more concealed, to the
                        men who lay open public vices; <del>exclusion</del> the prospect of all
                        these things shut; irrevocably shut, if they shew him [<emph>sic</emph>
                        them] any favour. Not that such men will <del>want</del> be without lawyers
                        to defend them. If they were not ready to defend them, it would too much
                        expose the craft. But they must take care to defend them in such a manner,
                        as to shew how much they dislike [them], and therefore to suggest to you,
                        gentlemen, that they ought to be condemned. These, gentlemen, are the
                        reasons, gentlemen, which have impelled me to try what I could
                            <del>say</del> do in my defence. You <del>will see</del> cannot but
                        allow with me gentlemen, that the situation of a lawyer is such as
                        powerfully to excite him against such a man as me, and I know no lawyer of
                        the present times who I think has risen completely above the temptations of
                        his situation. <note>Written on a letter cover postmarked

                        have therefore against me—and I have nobody to protect me, gentlemen.
                        Happily, gentlemen, by a yet unviolated part our constitution, you have the

                    <p>1. Influence of intention on the criminality of a libel. <note>The paragraph
                            numbers formerly above, have been put at the head of each paragraph.
                            This sheet is divided into four vertical columns, just like the summary
                            sheets to be found in the Bentham mss.</note></p>
                    <p>Take the case of defamation, the commonest and most important case of
                        libel.</p>
                    <p>Intention has no such effect on the mischief of the act as in the case of
                        most other offences.</p>
                    <p>2. In homicide, if no bad intention, intention to kill or hurt, there is no
                        evil of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> order—always, by far the most important
                        evil.</p>
                    <p>3. Otherwise in defamation—the evil of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> order not
                        necessarily lessened by good intention.</p>
                    <p>4. When a man imputes an offence to another, his intention to make him be
                        regarded as guilty of the offence imputed is not matter of doubt.</p>
                    <p>5. Ulterior intention—ex. gr., booksellers to gain money, not material.</p>
                    <p>6. Under the word intention, different ideas are confounded,</p>

                        extenuate not, when the intention in question is criminal, want of knowledge
                        does, though accompanied with temerity or negligence.</p>
                    <p>9. Viz., in defamation when the defamer believes the imputations true:
                        extenuation the stronger, the stronger the reason for such his belief; i.e.,
                        the greater the probative force of the evidence which operated on him.</p>
                    <p>10. Non-knowledge, why thus extenuating?</p>

                    <p>11. 2. Evil of 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> order small—and easily reparable—viz.,
                        by recantation.</p>
                    <p>12. 3. Less punishment necessary to prevent a man from defaming through
                        negligence or temerity—i.e., from mere want of carefulness, than to deter
                        him from a design suggested by sinister interest.</p>
                    <p>13. In the case of the republishing bookseller, non-knowledge operates as a
                        ground of extenuation, if not of justification.</p>
                    <p>14. Moreover it proves all punishment unmeet, because needless.</p>
                    <p>15. And preponderantly expensive.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap7rc"/>16. Sole means of taking away this ground of
                        extenuation—and exemption—an <emph>Index expurgatorius.</emph></p>
                    <p>17. Application to the case in hand—An author’s, or first publisher’s,
                        criminal intention (publication proved) requires no proof.</p>
                    <p>18. But this will not save the Judge’s position from the imputation of
                        injustice—for in the instrument of accusation in question ulterior charges
                        are contained which the position would have credited without and against
                        proof.</p>
                    <p>19. To mask the injustice, the word form employed—form, a standard instrument
                        of iniquity, having no other function than to defeat the objects, and
                        disfulfil the engagements of the legislature in statute law—and to plunder
                        suitors for the benefit of Judge &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>20. In defamation, the instrument of accusation is thus made the instrument
                        of false defamation, or wrongful vituperation, or both.</p>
                    <p>21. Consequence—the Jury compelled or inveigled upon their oaths to find a
                        man, an innocent man, guilty of intention to produce, any crime, sedition,
                        or rebellion.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap7rd"/>22. Unlicensed defamers, those who speak
                        true—Judge &amp; Co self-licensed to defame falsely.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap7rdv"/>To the abuses of the political sanction, the
                        nature of things admits of no remedy, but the opposition of the popular. NB
                        This an important proposition—the foundation of the liberty of the press—the
                        justifying cause of exciting the public attention to acts of
                        misgovernment.</p>

                    <p>Many are the cases in which the jury have it in their power to fix the rate
                        of punishment—ex. gr., they fix all damages—In thefts, they can say a man
                        stole only to a certain value—they can recommend to a pardon—in libel cases,
                        no such thing—all is left to the judge—and his helpmate—the jailor.</p>
                    <p>We must perpetually praise—never dispraise—acts of parliament, conduct of

                        may be done. But what can be done when they act in flat subversion of one
                        another? See instances of this opposition, upon discharge of prisoners on

                        understanding. This a good. Debates in Parliament—Speeches of Lawyers,
                        instances, in which this influence is sought to be exerted. This influence
                        liable to abuse—false arguments mislead. Is this a reason, why all attempts
                        to instruct, should be interdicted? Libel law does not interdict all
                        instruction. It only interdicts all on one side. It is equivalent to such a
                        law as this—a law that should render it criminal in judicature to offer
                        evidence on any but the criminal’s side.</p>

                        Burke. “It is possible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or design
                        artfully conducted, ministers may suffer one part of government to languish,
                        another to be perverted from its purposes, and every valuable interest of
                        the country to fall into ruin and decay, without possibility of fixing any
                        single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded.” Burke,

                        have a preventive operation as well as a remedial. It ought to have a
                        natural tendency to exclude bad men from government, and not to trust for
                        the safety of the state to subsequent punishment alone: punishment which has
                        ever been tardy and uncertain; and which when power is suffered in bad hands
                        may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal.”

                    <p>The want of the freedom of the press to be numbered among the causes of the
                        atrocities of the French revolution. The French reformers entirely ignorant
                        of the nature of liberty. They had been fired with declamations, of their
                        own and other peoples, respecting its prodigious value, but they had not
                        been instructed wherein it consisted. Their errors therefore were one
                        leading cause of the wrong direction which the revolution took. Had the
                        press been free, they must have been more instructed. Their previous
                        writings would have been fully canvassed, and they would have been obliged
                        to go deeper. By their antagonists, all the possible ways in which an
                        attempt at a change in the government could take a wrong course, would have
                        been carefully searched out, and displayed in the most striking colours. The
                        reformers, to answer those objections, must have sought out for the means of
                        preventing <del>thus the every species</del> all those possible aberrations.
                        By this means they would have found out what were the measures that could
                        not, or not easily be prevented from going wrong—they would have
                        distinguished them from those that could easily be prevented from going
                        wrong. Of these they would have understood beforehand, when and how they
                        were liable to go wrong—what was the remedy—and would thus have been fully
                        prepared to apply it. The great body of the people too, familiarized with
                        these discussions would have had their imaginations in a much less
                        inflammatory state.—Such would have been the effects of freedom—what was the
                        actual state? There being no freedom of the press but by connivance, a bold
                        book stole out now and then—but being looked upon as punishable, those who
                        disliked it did not set themselves to refute it, and expose its
                        errors—no—they only called for punishment upon the author, and suppression
                        of the book. In this manner only one side of the question was really and
                        truly known.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be very little considered how much the freedom of the press is
                        calculated to prevent the bad effects which are apprehended from it. It is
                        an organ which is wieldable on both sides. In respect even of private
                        character, the fear of reprisals would in general act as a sufficient
                        restraint. <note>On a piece of paper of the same quality and type as 7v1,

                    <p>The Stoics did not think it improper to punish injury, which they said

                        qualifying a legislator. […] It doth not appear from all you have said, how
                        any one perfection is required to the attainment of any one station among
                        you.” <note><emph>Gulliver’s Travels</emph>, P. II, c. 6, in Swift,

                    <p>“I remember very well,” says Gulliver, “in a discourse one day with the king,
                        when I happened to say there were several thousand books among us written on
                        the science of government, it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a
                        very mean opinion of our understandings. He professed both to abominate and
                        despise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a
                        [minister. He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, when an enemy
                        or some rival nation were not in the case. He confined the knowledge of
                        governing within very narrow bounds; to common sense and reason, to justice
                        and lenity, to speedy determination of civil and criminal causes.”]

                    <p>The principal ingredients of a chief minister, says Swift, are three,

                        greatest part of our necessary things, and bring back in return “the
                        materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend among ourselves. Hence it
                        follows of necessity that vast numbers of our people are compelled to seek
                        their livelihood by begging, robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping,
                        flattering, suborning, forswearing, forging, gaming, lying, fawning,

                        Moleville, a very short time before the trial and death of Louis 16<hi

                            <emph>History of the Revolution.</emph> After several other topics had
                        been taken up and dropt, Malesherbes goes upon the following and says, “Do
                        you know that one of the greatest vices of our government, and perhaps the
                        most dangerous of all, no matter who the king is or how well intentioned he
                        be, is the impossibility of being assured when he nominates a minister that
                        he has made a good choice. He has no means of knowing by himself the
                        individuals who are proposed to him; he is thus forced to leave it to the
                        testimony of the persons who approach him, and a man that is said to be full
                        of talent is really one that is full of intrigue, or one to give many places
                        and pensions to the creatures of a favourite, of a lady of the court, of a
                        mistress of a prince or a minister in favour. The reign of these ministers
                        is not long; but those who succeed them, chosen in the same manner, are
                        rarely better, often much worse, and are well replaceable by others of the
                        same stamp. That is why government is going to the devil and why revolutions
                        occur. … Survey all of them, you will not find one which was not the crime
                        of the minister, that is to say, of the weakness, of the negligence, of the
                        incapacity or the perfidy of the ministers. Those who accuse the
                        constitution are imbeciles or men of bad faith; be certain of what I am
                        telling you. I do not doubt it, I replied to him, and I conclude that a law
                        which declared the death penalty against all the ministers in office, at the
                        time when a revolution broke out, would be a law both just and
                        salutary.—That would certainly be the most counter-revolutionary and even
                        the most humane law of all despite its severity; for how many millions of
                        men have perished by revolutions! … What I have said of the minister could
                        apply equally to all in office and to all employers of some importance. … We
                        have had some good intendants, and some good high court judges, but how many
                        more mediocrities and how many more below that! I know well that it was not
                        the fault of our constitution and without changing the constitution it would
                        be very easy to prevent intrigue and favour from influencing nominations in
                        any manner. It would suffice to re-establish for all the positions requiring
                        talent and merit the old form of elections, ameliorated and modified in such
                        a way as to render a bad choice impossible; but in order to have that, the
                        king would have to want it, would have to want it strongly, and that is the
                        difficulty. Nothing is rarer than a strong will in kings, and unfortunately
                        that is what is lacking in ours.” [F] <emph>Histoire de la Revolution de

                    <p>Of the utility and even necessity to the king, of the publication of the
                        parliamentary debates—of the base deceptions that were practised upon him
                        with regard to what passed in parliament, an impressive example is found in
                        Burnett. Upon the opening of the parliament in 1673, Lord Clifford had, in
                        the house of Lords, made a speech, the king presu[med?] violent for high
                        measures, which highly pleased the king—and Lord Shaftesbury, then
                        chancellor made one more moderate, which gave great offence. The king’s
                        advisers were divided, one set for <del>strong</del> high, the other for
                        yielding measures. The latter had recourse to the following means of
                        deception, which there being no report of parliamentary proceedings in those
                        days, was successful.</p>
                    <p>“In the afternoon of the day in which the matter had been argued in the house
                        of Lords, the Earls of Shaftesbury and Arlington got all those members of
                        the house of Commons on whom they had any influence, (and who had money from
                        the King, and were his spies, but had leave to vote with the party against
                        the Court, for procuring them the more credit) to go privately to him, and
                        to tell him, that, upon Lord Clifford’s speech, the house was in such fury,
                        that probably they would have gone to some high votes or impeachments: but
                        the Lord Shaftesbury speaking on the other side restrained them: they
                        believed, he spoke the King’s sense, as the other did the Duke’s: […] this
                        calmed them. So they made the King apprehend, that the Lord Chancellor’s
                        Speech, with which he had been so much offended, was really a great service
                        done him: and they persuaded him further, that he might now save himself,
                        and obtain an indemnity for his ministers, if he would part with the
                        declaration, and pass the bill. This was so dexterously managed by Lord
                        Arlington, who got a great number to go one after another to the King, who
                        by concert spoke all the same language, that, before night, the King was
                        quite changed.” etc. Burnett’s <emph>Own times</emph>, v. II, p. 77.

                            II, pp. 69*-75*, “Unanimous Opinion of the Judges upon the several
                            Questions put to them upon the second Reading of the Bill to remove
                            Doubts respecting the Functions of Juries in Cases of Libel, April 27,
                            1792, as delivered by the Lord Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer”:
                            “That the criminality or innocence of <emph>any act done</emph> (which
                            includes any paper written) is the result of the judgement which the law
                            pronounces upon that act, and therefore must be in all cases, and under
                            all circumstances, matter of law and not matter of fact. … [T]he truth
                            or falsehood of a written or printed paper is not material, or to be
                            left to a jury upon the trial of an indictment or information for a
                            libel. We consider this doctrine as so firmly settled, and so
                            essentially necessary to the maintenance of the king’s peace, and the
                            good order of society, that it cannot now be drawn into debate. … In the
                            action for libel, the plaintiff is not put to prove the matter of the
                            libel to be false. … The crime consists in publishing a libel; a
                            criminal intention in the writer is no part of the definition of the
                            crime of libel at the common law. ‘He who <emph>scattereth firebrands,
                                arrows</emph>, and <emph>death</emph>,’ (which, if not an accurate
                            definition, is a very intelligent description of a libel) is <emph>ea
                                ratione</emph> criminal; it is not incumbent on the prosecutor to
                            prove his intent. … {I} t is the duty of the jury, if they will find a
                            general verdict upon the whole matter in issue, <emph>to compound that
                                verdict of the fact as it appears in evidence before them, and of
                                the law as it is declared to them by the judge.</emph>”</note></p>
                    <p>Neither understood what was meant by law nor by fact—In the case of statute
                        law—the question of law is—what is the meaning of the words of the
                        statute—in the case of unwritten law, the question is—to feign a set of
                        words, for the occasion, in which the law shall be declared to be
                        included—for the next occasion of the same sort, the question is, to feign
                        another set of words—and then every decision on a point of unwritten law is
                        upon an <emph>ex-post-facto</emph> law, fabricated for each individual
                        occasion. Proof that judges make libel law whatsoever they please—Lord

                        the good obtainable by the persons in high station by being exempt from that
                        hurt.—The highest men expose themselves—and even greedily to the scrutiny of
                        contested elections—yet by this they expose themselves to all kinds of

                    <p>As in Natural Procedure throughout—the plaintiff should be examinable on his

                        answer there cannot be a stronger proof that the facts with which he is
                        charged—whether having their seat in the intellectual or moral part of his
                        frame, are true.</p>
                    <p>? When did the use of Imprimatur begin and end in England? If it existed not
                        in the time of the Star Chamber—why then by the definition of the English
                        judges, there was then liberty of the press in England. <note>It began in
                            1538, and ended, or rather lapsed, in 1694.</note></p>
                    <p>When the newspapers published the letters of Lord Castlereagh and Mr. Canning
                        accusing one another of incapacity and unprobity [improbity]—they were
                        guilty of libels—and every one who read them aloud in any body’s hearing—or
                        who repeated any of their contents to any body—were those great men
                        themselves libellers? <note>After their duel, 19 September 1809, letters of
                            a most remarkable frankness were exchanged between them of 19/9 and
                            20/9/1809, which all the public papers printed and commented
                            upon.</note></p>
                    <p><emph>Freedom of the Press in England</emph>? How? By breach of the law—by
                        the law is [<emph>sic</emph>] not being enforced. By the law, there is not a
                        book, about men, and their actions, the publication of which is free. But
                        the men who publish them are not always punished, and for that reason there
                        is freedom. What is the practical consequence of this? That all men who
                        write are placed in the condition of men under arbitrary power. Monarchs,
                        whose power is the most arbitrary, do not take the property, and immure the
                        person, of every individual in their dominions. They only do so to a few
                        individuals, one, now and then; but they have always the power of doing it
                        to any one they please. This is exactly the case between the government, and
                        all the writing part of the public in England. Whatever may be the case with
                        the rest, all persons connected with the press are in the most strict sense
                        of the word in the state of slaves—existing out of prison, or unstripped of
                        their property, merely by the good pleasure of the men in power.</p>
                    <p>Examples of impunity invite to crime—the sovereign power the inviter. Of the
                        breach of the law of libel, the cases innumerable—the consequence
                        plain.—“The same fact, if it have been constantly punished in other men, is
                        a greater crime, than if there had been many precedent examples of impunity.
                        For those examples are so many hopes of impunity given by the sovereign
                        himself: And because he which furnishes a man with such a hope and
                        presumption of mercy as encourageth him to offend, hath his part in the
                        offence; he cannot reasonably charge the offender with the whole.” Hobbes,

                    <p>Burke, having stated that the <emph>laws</emph> of this country are more
                        directed to the support of government than the protection of liberty, says
                        that, on this account whatever is done by persons not created with public
                        trust in favour of liberty is apt to appear opposite to the laws—and the
                        laws are so severe against it, that but for juries they would be fatal.
                        “Nothing,” says he, “can hinder that severe letter from crushing us, except
                        the temperaments it may receive from a trial by Jury.” <emph>Thoughts on the

                        Montesquieu places liberty in an exemption from fear: are persons who enjoy

                        of what might be done by juries—who taking upon themselves to judge where
                        mischief was intended, “would not, by a verdict, finding the fact, expose to
                        a punishment which the[y] deemed not deserved.”</p>

                        that they were encouraged, if not inflamed by the city of London, he
                        summoned the next Parliament to meet at Oxford. It was said, men were now
                        very bold about London, by their confidence in the juries that the sheriffs
                        took care to return. Several printers were indicted for scandalous libels
                        that they had printed: but the grand juries returned an ignoramus upon the
                        bills against them, on this pretence, that the law only condemned the
                        printing such libels maliciously and seditiously, and that it did not appear
                        that the printers had any ill intentions in what they did; whereas, if it
                        was found that they printed such libels the construction of law made that to

                        justly, however guardedly, has not a tendency to produce a breach of the

                        creating a breach of the peace, would constitute that writing criminal? A

                        is to say, there ought to be no censure of the measures of government
                        whatever. This is what I understand you to mean. Is there a free press under
                        Bonaparte? But under Bonaparte there is freedom to praise.</p>
                    <p>Freedom of the press means freedom of censure—freedom of censure is of great

                        censure, renders the press mischievous, not useful—an instrument of

                    <p>To cramp the liberty of the press by a vague law is as much as the worst
                        inclinations durst do—An all-comprehensive law is possibly the very best
                        method of cutting off the good effects of the press—hanging the terrors of
                        the law over every body, and letting them fall on just as many as the spirit
                        of the country will bear. Paley says it is the best method of suppressing
                        crimes, to hang a heavy punishment <emph>in terrorem</emph> over them all,
                        and let it fall only on a select number. It is possibly the only method
                        which the spirit of a people accustomed to resist their rulers would permit
                        to be employed for the destruction of the press. <note>Paley, <emph>The

                        legal system. More than the civil law, though the civil law had all the

                    <p>2. The civil law the perfection of reason—English common law better—for its

                        sense of injury? Injury to bad men? bad governments?</p>
                    <p>49. Injury to character, the mischief for which a remedy is sought by the law
                        of libel. No injury to character, when truth is spoken, but an injury to
                        society, when it is concealed—if the publication of untruth punished—the
                        concealment of truth should be the same.</p>
                    <p>50. No private individual has a right to publish any thing affecting

                        course there is no liberty of the press. Liberty of the press consists in
                        this. It is not liberty to be free to write, what nobody would dislike.</p>

                        its extinction—phrases used to denote a liberty, which is no liberty at

                        question of their virtue or probity; but of their feelings, habits, manners,
                        and prudence. They may be, as they often are, mercenary, selfish, rapacious,
                        unprincipled. But it is not in acts like those alluded to, that these
                        dispositions will shew themselves, even in persons who feel them most. It
                        might as well be supposed, that they could seek to enrich themselves by

                    <p>The advocates of abuses cry—Shameful the abuse of public men! Impudent the

                        Where the proof of their virtue? etc.—Answer. To cry out against abuses—to
                        cry out laudably and meritoriously, does not necessarily imply that the man
                        who cries out, pronounces himself better than the man he cries out against.
                        To cry out against the <del>authors of</del> profiters by abuses does not
                        necessarily imply that such men are worse than other men. It only implies
                        that they are men on whom a great private interest prevails over public
                        interests—and who are the men on whom it does not? The object of the cry is
                        not to traduce those men—for in truth the stronger the virtue is of the men
                        whose virtue is thus overcome, the stronger is the reason for reforming that
                        unhappy state of things which works on them such baneful effects. Public men
                        like private—vicious or virtuous as it is their interest to be. Present

                    <p>H. Brougham <note>George Manners, 1778-1853, consul at Boston, 1819-39. As
                            editor and founder of the <emph>Satirist</emph> (1807), he was
                            responsible for a variety of scurrilous attacks on opponents of the
                            Tories. Walter Coulson, 1794?-1860, was the parliamentary reporter for
                            the <emph>Morning Chronicle</emph> at the time. Though this letter will

                    <p>Gentlemen, <del>what I am going to maintain is</del>These enemies of ours
                        imagine, that you are patient, because you are ignorant. Gentlemen, the case
                        is the very reverse. It is because you know you are strong, that you know
                        you may be patient. You know, that whenever you chuse it, nothing can resist
                        you. This is no secret to you. They imagine, gentlemen, that it is. They
                        have not been at pains to study you, as I have. I know well, that in your
                        little parties there is no topic more commonly discussed, and more clearly
                        understood than this is. You are therefore contented to wait in the hope
                        that time will give your desire by peaceable means. And this gentlemen is
                        wisdom. You know that the thing is always in your own hands, when you chuse.
                        Therefore, you have no occasion to seize an imperfect opportunity. You may
                        safely wait for the perfect one. Were the case different, gentlemen; were
                        your strength really doubtful, your wisdom would be different. Then,
                        gentlemen, it would be your duty to seize promptly at any risk, the very
                        first opportunity that offered but a probable prospect of success.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, it is no secret to you, I have heard it discussed at the
                        blacksmith’s anvil, and on the tailor’s board, with more precision than I
                        ever did in a legislative assembly; that the strength of those who domineer
                        over us is not made out of their own flesh and blood. It is made out of our
                        obedience: And the moment that ceases, what do they become? A few impotent
                        individuals, and nothing more.</p>
                    <p>What is wanting, gentlemen, is, a long pull—and a strong pull—and a pull
                        altogether. The long pull [ha]s begun, and has continued for some time. It
                            <del>is every day increasing and going on, and</del>will in time, (it is
                        every day on the advance) be a strong <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap13vb"/>pull.
                        After that it will soon be, (let us not anticipate the moment) be a pull
                        altogether. And then, gentlemen, the power of our enemies, will lie like the
                        withers that bound the hands of Samson. They will dissolve like flax, when
                        it is treated with flame. Then, gentlemen, what shall we do with our
                        enemies? Having nothing more to fear from them gentlemen, we will treat them
                        with kindness. We will still remember, that they are not only our fellow
                        creatures, but they are our countrymen; that they are our brothers. We will
                        remember, gentlemen, that formerly when they were able to domineer over us,
                        they only yielded to the strong temptation of their situation; as we too
                        often yield to the strong temptations of ours. We shall reflect, gentlemen,
                        that if we had been placed in their situation, the strong temptations of it
                        would have been too effectual in overpowering ourselves. We will, therefore,
                        treat them gentlemen, as we would treat our brothers and our sons, who have
                        injured us, after we have placed them in a situation in which they cannot
                        injure us. We will endeavour to make friends of them, and get them to do us
                        good. We shall have no resentments, no revenges; no after reckonings; we
                        shall look backwards for nothing but experience to guide us in the future.
                        Let us calm their unmanly fears. Not a hair of their heads shall be touched.
                        Not an atom of their property shall be withdrawn. We know well, gentlemen,
                        that the good of society depends upon security being enjoyed by every man of
                        using that which he earns. The poorest of us all, gentlemen, is as fully
                        convinced of that principle, as the richest of them. And we know well
                        gentlemen that none of us can be secured in enjoyment of what he earns,
                        without security of property in general. <note>Biblical reference to

                            Cobbett’s</emph> Debates<emph>,</emph> v. <emph>14, p. 736.</emph>
                        <note>This set of notes on Windham’s speech, was clearly not pasted into the
                            volume in correct order. Between 17r and 22v some transpositions of text
                            have been introduced in order to restore Mill’s original order. The
                            material comes from the debate on Mr. Curwen’s Reform Bill (26/5/1809),
                            in Hansard, <emph>PD</emph>, XIV 736-72. The page numbers have been
                            added only where Mill’s references are inadequate, and the paragraph
                            numbers have been put at the head of, instead of over, each paragraph.
                            17v, 20r, and 20v are blank.</note></p>
                    <p>1. Pleased to hear the two former speeches—recalled attention to the points
                        in debate, from which Sir Francis Burdett’s had withdrawn it, though not by
                        topics altogether alien, but to which Windham would advert. p. 736.</p>
                    <p>2. Windham’s opinion not changed. Proposed measure, founded on mistaken
                        ideas, and leading to dangerous consequences—<emph>ill-timed</emph>—A
                        mistaken idea, that selling and buying of seats is corrupt. The truism of no
                        use, “that what is bad cannot be justified, by the length of time it has
                        been practised.”—Is it bad, is the question? Windham should be sorry if it
                        were; because it has been practised by the best times and the best men of
                        our history. 737, 8, 9.</p>
                    <p>3. It is asked, if the sale of all places of trust is criminal? Places were
                        sold in the parliaments under the old monarchy of France—Panegyric on these
                        parliaments—and reprobation of the narrow notions of England, who thinks
                        nothing good that is different from her own—So little does fact answer to
                        theory!—In our own country part of the income of judges arises from the sale
                        of judicial places—Sale of advowsons, is the sale of church places. Sale of
                        seats in <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap17rb"/>parliament not therefore corrupt,
                        on the simple principle that it is corrupt to take a valuable consideration,
                        for nomination to a place of trust. 739-40, 41.</p>
                    <p>4. For if such sale were so corrupt, it is a situation corrupt, to have a
                        seat to sell—this the throne of the grievance—this the place to apply the
                        remedy—while men have seats to sell, and they are worth the buying, the
                        mutual interests of the parties will enable them to effect the bargain. The
                        men who want to subvert the influence of property, will drive the doctrine
                        to this point. p. 741-2.</p>
                    <p>5. Objection: that the sale of seats, and the legitimate influence of
                        property, different things—Answer—Windham is arguing this question upon
                        principle—and principle unites dissimilar things—as dissimilar as the sale
                        of a seat, and the influence which places it at his disposal. 742.</p>
                    <p>6. The influence of property which operates through beneficence is a refined
                        influence—There is another influence more direct and gross. Where is the
                        line of separation? The influence of a landlord over his tenants—of a
                        manufacturer over his workmen—a man of fortune, on the tradesmen <anchor
                            xml:id="cpb2scrap17rc"/>who supply his family—of what sort is it?
                        legitimate or not legitimate? If it be right to have this influence, by what
                        argument is it proved to be wrong, if a man studies his own interest not
                        wrongfully in the use of it? If it be wrong, how is property to have its
                        influence? In fact, the purchase of a seat is as legitimate a use of the
                        influence of property as any other—where no law has rendered it illegal. p.
                        742, 3, 4. <note>See <ref target="cpb2ch2scrap22v">22vb</ref></note></p>
                    <p>7. Has any law rendered it illegal? On the side of <hi rend="bold">Yes</hi>
                        it is said, the law prohibiting bribery to individual voters, is such a
                        law—because it would be absurd to condemn purchase in the detail and protect
                        it in the gross.—On the side of <hi rend="bold">No</hi> repeated the story
                        of stealing the goose from the common and the common from the goose.—Laws
                        have been against selling spirits by retail, though not by
                        wholesale—Asserted that the acts of giving money to the voter, and giving
                        money to the voter’s master are acts totally disparate. 745, 6.</p>
                    <p>8. If the law <emph>has</emph> rendered the act illegal, there is no use for
                        a new law, to do what is already done. 746, 7.</p>
                    <p>9. The case, then, is, that the sale of seats is condemned, neither by
                            <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap17rd"/>morality, nor law, if any law remains to
                        be made about it. The legislature is therefore left to determine, if there
                        would be <emph>advantage</emph> in abolishing it. p. 747.</p>

                    <p>11. The question arises out of the epidemical passion which has
                            <emph>suddenly</emph> seized us, to tear the government to pieces, this
                        measure a <emph>stepping stone</emph> to that object. p. 748.</p>
                    <p>12. The existence of such a disposition is denied—and the abuses by the duke
                        of York assigned as the cause of the popular discontent. But the abuses of
                        the duke of York represented as a trifle, and inadequate to produce a
                        general opinion that parliament is inadequate to the functions of good
                        government. p. 748. <note>pp. 748-9. A reference to Augustus Frederick, Duke
                            of York and Albany (1763-1827), second son of George III. It was
                            alleged, in 1809, that as commander-in-chief of the British army, he had

                    <p>13. Why is it called a libel on the people of England to say that there are
                        among them vast numbers who want to destroy the government? And especially
                        those who libel parliament by saying it is inadequate to its pretended
                        purposes? There are…</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap18va"/>…always persons in every country ready to
                        pull down every government—apprehended difficulty being the only
                        restraint—actuated by various passions, and various views. 749-50.</p>
                    <p>14. No reason to suppose that a man who has given an individual sum of money
                        to an individual patron, will be more desirous to reimburse himself by
                        sinister means, than the man who has spent 3 times as much in a contested
                        election. <del>The fact is on the severe side</del> Experience confirms this
                        reasoning. 750-51.</p>
                    <p>15. The landed man thinks political power should be on his side—the monied
                        man, on his—the man of talents on his. Men of high rank and consequence, men
                        with much to lose, not less ardent for changes affording the chance of
                        raising their consequence, than the most needy. 751.</p>
                    <p>16. Reformers never care for the welfare of mankind—industry and perseverance
                        their instruments. 752.</p>
                    <p>17. Five and twenty years ago, the subverters attempted their work by
                        abstract reasoning—Actual grievances were not pointed out—the constitution
                        was speculatively bad—but the French revolution has discredited this mode of
                        attack. Now, the plan <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap18vb"/>is to take particular
                        points, to which discontent is directed, or on which the disposition to
                        discontent, which always exists, may be fastened. 752-53.</p>
                    <p>18. Particular cause of discontent in this country—its riches _taxes_. We are
                        luxurious, always spend up to our means, hate <del>restriction</del>
                        retrenchment the more, the more we have to spend: and hence grumble at the
                        taxes, though never so able to pay—Our riches are immense. If we would
                        content ourselves with living as people lived 40 years ago, we should have
                        no difficulty in paying all our taxes. 753-54, 5.</p>
                    <p>19. Our immense establishments, naval, military, etc., the cause of our vast
                        expenditure.—No say the Reformers—the abuses are. 755-6.</p>
                    <p>20. The cry against taxes—and abuses that generate taxes; always greedily
                        listened to. The persons who raise it want to destroy the government. 756,
                            <note>pp. 756-7.</note></p>
                    <p>21. Abuses are of two kinds—1. Abuse of patronage. 2. Appropriating or
                        applying corruptly public money. 757.</p>
                    <p>23. <note>There is no section 22.</note> The first sort is the one belonging
                        to the members of government, the men <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap18vc"/>in
                        high station—low stealing is not their vice, however rapacious—and rapacious
                        and regardless of public interest, to an intolerable degree they are allowed
                        to be. The number, however, of these men of station is not great; and the
                        country cannot suffer much by gorging them. 757-758.</p>
                    <p>24. The misapplication of public money, its embezzlement, peculation, etc.,
                        in the divided, and subdivided streams, this is the grand and enormous cause
                        of the enormous expenditure. But who are the profiters by these abuses? The
                        people themselves. 758.</p>
                    <p>25. Jobs are generated, by voters applying to members—members applying to
                        ministers, for shares, in all manner of ways, of the public money. This is
                        the grand cause of <del>our expense</del> the abuse of patronage. 759.</p>
                    <p>26. The country full of <del>abuses</del> corruption—Granted—says
                        Windham—only the people are the corruptest part. 760.</p>
                    <p>27. Peculation—embezzlement—swells the expenditure greatly beyond its natural
                        size—but this is not imputable to the government—Is it imputable to the
                        government, that all the subordinate <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap18vd"/>agents
                        are striving to cheat the public? but these inferior cheats are the people
                        themselves—“The people individually cheat the people collectively, and find
                        in their own knaveries a reason for tearing the government to pieces.”
                        761-2.</p>
                    <p>28. Of the abuse of patronage, the greater part produced by the people. When
                        his own connections are gorged, a minister would then give places to the
                        best men—but the selfish demands of those on whom his power depends will not
                        let him. 763. <note>pp. 762-3.</note></p>
                    <p>29. Not the blame of government that it cannot prevent this. Individuals
                        cannot prevent abuses in their own families. 763.</p>
                    <p>30. This evil increases and in a geometrical rate with the increase of
                        establishments. There is a laxity with respect to abuses upon large funds.
                        There is an almost total want of feeling in regard to the expenditure of
                        public money—an universal desire to appropriate it corruptly. 764.</p>
                    <p>31. In this state, there are men for breaking up the government because it
                        cannot prevent abuses—while the corruption is the corruption, not of the
                        government, but of the people. 764.</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap19ra"/>32. Next inquiry is—who they are that revile
                        the parliament, and by scattering their reproaches, arrogate to themselves
                        the being the only honest men. What proofs of virtue and disinterestedness
                        have they shewn? Nothing so easy as to be a patriot.—Pitt shewed more
                        self-denial than ever Sir Francis Burdett did, when he went out of office
                        upon the catholic question. 764, 5, 6.</p>
                    <p>33. Men who have been in office as virtuous as their accusers. 767.</p>
                    <p>34. Upon the whole—“abuses are the bribes which government pays to the
                        people, to prevent them from tearing it to pieces”—more especially the worst
                        kind of abuses, the abuses of patronage—and the great mass of the money that
                        is misapplied, by peculation, etc., composing qZ9ZpZ9Zpz of all that is
                        misapplied, goes into the pockets of the people. 768.</p>
                    <p>35. It is proposed to correct these evils, by reforming, as it is called, the
                        government, that is, by giving more power to the people—but the people are
                        the very peccant part. 768-9.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap19rb"/>36. There are only three ways in which men
                        can be governed—1. by their virtues—2. by their fears—3. by their interests.
                        1. The British people have not virtues to be governed by. 2. Give government
                        powers enough to govern them by their fears, you destroy the freedom of the
                        constitution. 3. What remains is—to govern them by their interests—i.e.,
                        bribing them by abuses. 769.</p>
                    <p>37. Bonaparte has no occasion for corruption because he governs men by their
                        fears. 769.</p>
                    <p>38. To prevent the sale of seats—part of a general system to subvert the
                        government, on the pretext of abuses—of which abuses the people are the
                        cause. 770.</p>
                    <p>39. Recommended to all Reformers to distrust the consequences of their
                        measures. 771-2.</p>

                    <p>1. Reprobation stamped on Sir Francis Burdett’s doctrine at the very
                        beginning—intimation conveyed by insinuation, that they are fraught with
                        mischief. Why not? This is the <emph>portendum</emph>! <note>Last two
                            sentences added in pencil—virtually illegible.</note></p>
                    <p>2. <emph>Ill-timed</emph>, along with the epithets, <emph>unfounded,
                            mischievous</emph>, in argument he denominated <emph>ill-placed.</emph>
                        Good doctrines may be ill-timed—for bad doctrines no time is good.</p>
                    <p>Truism etc., of no use—Do you say so Mr. Windham, and yet in the same breath
                        say that the sale of seats having been practised by our ancestors would make
                        you sorry to find it corrupt?—No defence of a bad thing that it is old—and
                        yet you love them before inquiry, because old? If it is no defence of it
                        that it is old, why tell us that our ancestors practised it; and that you
                        have an aversion to find that your ancestors have been wrong. If the sale of
                        seats is pernicious, and our ancestors practised it, so much the worse for
                        them and for us—and if we continue it so much the worse for us and for our
                        posterity.—Of no importance do you say to bring forward this
                            <emph>truism</emph>, when you have no sooner said so than you bring
                        forward the <emph>falsism</emph>, which contradicts it? A truism, you say,
                        that what is bad cannot be defended, by the age or names of those who
                        practise it—yet immediately you tell us, that what has been practised by
                        such and such persons, you love without knowing whether it is good or
                        bad.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap22rb"/>3. True—sale of seats not <del>in its own
                            nature criminal</del> criminal simply because the sale of a place of
                        trust—it is of little consequence how members <emph>come</emph> into
                        parliament, provided there is security they will do their duty when there.
                        If the <emph>mode of coming in</emph> contributes to that security it is
                            <del>good</del> important—if not, not—Place of judge might be sold,
                        without danger—but why say, that in this case, practice, as in France,
                        contradicted theory—for theory says and always would have said the same
                        thing. It may be a very good thing to cast mud upon theory—but a little
                        moderation would be wise. One would cast it, when theory suffers by it—but
                        one would not when theory must necessarily gain. When theory says that the
                        three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones, theory had better
                        not be blamed—When it says, that the three are less or more, then would be
                        the time for the mud and the dirt. When it says that improvement is good,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>4. True again—if the sale of seats is pernicious—it is pernicious to leave
                        matters in such a state that any one should have a seat to sell. If a man
                        has a seat to sell, it makes little difference if he <emph>gives</emph> it
                        to a man for voting as he bids him, or <emph>sells</emph> it to one who is
                        at liberty to vote as he pleases. That any man should have a seat to sell,
                        is the grievance undoubtedly. And if the sale of seats be bad, <emph>not
                            those only who want to destroy the influence of</emph>
                        <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap22rc"/><emph>property</emph>—but those who wish the
                        termination of bad government <emph>ought</emph> to carry their hostility to
                        that point.</p>
                    <p>5. This paragraph somewhat obscure—possibly somewhat unmeaning.</p>
                    <p>6. Between the legitimate and non-legitimate influence of property, to draw
                        the line of distinction, is as incumbent upon Windham as upon his
                        antagonists. He asks his antagonists, where is the line—he then assumes or
                        seems to assume, that no line can be drawn—and then proceeds upon it as a
                        just inference that no influence of property can be bad. Then, suppose Sir
                        Francis Burdett should hire mobs to attack the parliament—should hire
                        writers to inflame the discontents—all within the limit of the law. The Duke
                        of Orleans maintained a vast number of desperadoes in idleness, who by that
                        very circumstance, and without any directions from him produced so many of
                        the mischiefs of the French revolution.—Property, like physical strength,
                        like eloquence, is a power—and all power may be turned to good or to bad
                        purposes—is money alone to be exempt from control? Does not the law controul
                        property, as much as any other power? (Enumerate the cases.) If it has
                        controuled it in many, but left some one or more cases, in which still it
                        would be good to controul it, shall the mere talk in the air about the
                        sacred <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap22rd"/>influence of property deter us from
                        increasing to ourselves the benefits of government?</p>
                    <p>It is the artifice of Windham to endeavour to make his hearers confound in
                        their own minds all controul of the influence of property with the
                        destruction of that influence.—No fear of property losing its influence—it
                        has always had, and will yet long continue to have too much.</p>
                    <p>Nothing therefore so unfounded, or so sophistical as to deter people from
                        attempts to increase the benefits of government by alarming them for the
                        influence of property.—See Supplemental part of this sheet. <note>See <ref

                    <p>7. In a particular place 5000 voters have the nomination to a seat—in another
                        place one individual has the nomination to a seat—To give a guinea to each
                        of the 5000 in the one case, and so get the seat, is expressly illegal—to
                        give a similar 5000 guineas to the individual, and so get the seat, is, says
                        Windham—perfectly legal.</p>
                    <p>The stealing the goose from the common <del>and the passing a bill to enclose
                            the common, surely very dissuasive incommensurate to these acts</del>
                        would apply were the question this—What does the man deserve who steals 50
                        geese from the common one by one? Answer—The Gallows—what does he deserve
                        who steals the fifty all in a lump?</p>
                    <p>If ever a law was made to prevent the sale of spirits in detail and allow it
                        in wholesale it was a very foolish law—and a foolish law being quoted,

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap21ra"/>To buy, says Windham, a seat from a voter is
                        bad—to buy it from the man who buys the voter, is not bad—to buy a seat from
                        12 men is bad—to buy it from one man is not bad—these are acts totally
                        different—and Windham is astonished at the stupidity or perfidy of those who
                        represent them as not different—to purchase a seat from the first hand is
                        bad, from the second perfectly good—one only remove wipes away all the
                        criminality—See Supplement on back of preceding sheet. <note>At <ref

                    <p>8. When the law is doubtful, or evaded—might not a new law, not doubtful, not
                        evadable, be a good thing?</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Windham slow in coming to the true point. Decide the question of
                        advantage, and stand excused <del>the orator for</del> for the rest.</p>
                    <p>10. Mr. Windham having touched upon the true point, immediately runs away
                        from it. He says not one word on the advantage or disadvantage of the
                        measure itself, but runs away to talk about the danger of all change, and
                        designs to subvert the government.</p>
                    <p>11. A design to tear the government to pieces ascribed to the promoters of
                        the measure—or at least to some who are ready to avail themselves of it.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap21rb"/>12. The existence of this design inferred
                        from the privation of [?] discontent, which the abuses by the Duke of York
                        are inadequate to account for.</p>
                    <p>13. No libel on the people of England to suppose there are many among them
                        with that disposition. Many such are under every government.</p>
                    <p>14. True but nugatory.</p>
                    <p>15. Men of rank and property not less inclined to be perturbators than
                        others.</p>
                    <p>16. Neither true nor to the purpose.</p>
                    <p>17-18. 25 years ago speculative imperfection was the reformers theme—at
                        present, it is particular grievances—chiefly taxes—taxes a good basis for a
                        superstructure of discontent.</p>
                    <p>From 18 to 31. Matter to prove that discontents are unfounded.</p>
                    <p><emph>Here then is Mr. Windham’s mode of arguing</emph>—</p>
                    <p>Problem—To shew whether advantage or disadvantage arises from the sale of
                        seats. I will shew it you immediately says Windham.—Change is
                        dangerous—discontents prevail—and discontents are unfounded—Now you know
                        whether selling of seats is a good thing or a bad.</p>
                    <p><emph>Theorem.</emph> A design exists among the people of England, to tear
                        the <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap21rc"/>government to pieces. That there does
                        says Windham, and the proof is—there are people ready to tear governments to
                        pieces in all countries always. Demonstration 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. There
                        are discontents among the people of England; and wherever there are
                        discontents among a people they want to tear the government to pieces.
                        Q.E.D.</p>
                    <p><emph>Theorem</emph> 2. The discontents among the people of England are
                        unfounded. Demonstration 1. They have more enjoyments than the people of 40
                        years ago. Demonstration 2. The principal part of the public money that is
                        wasted, finds its way into the pockets of individuals among the people.
                        Demonstration 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. The wickedness of the people
                        themselves is the cause of the abuses—they must be bribed with the abuses,
                        to prevent them from tearing the government to pieces. Demonstration 4.
                        Individuals cannot prevent abuses in their domestic establishments.
                        Corollary 1. Attempts to improve the government absurd—the corruption not in
                        the government but the people. Corollary 2. A law to prevent the sale of
                        seats, part of a <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap21rd"/>general system to subvert
                        the government under pretence of abuses—of which abuses, where any exist,
                        the people are the cause.</p>
                    <p><emph>Practical Conclusions</emph></p>
                    <p>Wherever there are people who want to tear government to pieces, then should
                        there be no improvement. But such people are every where. Accordingly there
                        should be no improvement any where.</p>
                    <p>Wherever there are discontents, there should be no improvement—but there are
                        discontents every where—therefore no improvement should be any where.</p>
                    <p>Whenever a man has more enjoyments than formerly, how much greater soever the
                        produce of his estate, he ought never to quarrel with the abuses of his
                        stewards.</p>
                    <p>If the master of a large family so regulates his affairs, that any small
                        portion of his servants are enabled to live by plundering the rest, his
                        servants are rogues if they complain.</p>
                    <p>Upon complaining they should be told, their own wickedness is the cause of
                        the abuses—they must be bribed with the abuses that the family may be
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>Wherever abuses [are, they] cannot be entirely prevented, no matter to what
                        excess they exist.</p>

                        happiness of mankind, being too much taken up with himself: this is a
                        numerous class, and known on one hand by the coldness with which they
                        discuss those vices big with the fall of empires; and on the other by their
                        impotent invectives against private vices. It is vain for such to say that
                        they have the public welfare at heart. ‘Were you really animated with such a
                        generous passion,’ it will be said to them, ‘your hatred to every vice would
                        be always proportionate to the mischief it does in society.’” [F] Helvetius,

                        says Windham, for not giving them a good government.</p>
                    <p>Two things—the one cause—the other effect—The cause cannot be altered—Why?
                        because the effect is a very undesirable one.</p>
                    <p>A man’s health is greatly injured by following the regimen of an unskillful
                        physician. But his health is very bad therefore he must not change his
                        physician.</p>
                    <p>Windham’s argument goes to say—that human nature is too base, ever to consort
                        with any thing but oppression. These were born to be for ever the prey of a
                        small number of themselves.</p>
                    <p>So long as a people is corrupt their government cannot be improved. But the
                        people can never be other than corrupt under a corrupt government—therefore
                        there never can be good government.</p>
                    <p>A corrupt people cannot have a good government—and never do any thing, says
                        Windham, to make the people less corrupt—let them have no education—that
                        spoils them. <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap19vc1"/>Does Windham say that where a
                        people is not corrupt, they are fit for a good government—Then will he tell
                        us how they are to be <emph>made</emph> not corrupt?</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, he would say—as the people get gradually and gradually less corrupt,
                        the government may be amended.</p>
                    <p>Does he expect that men will ever be in a state, in which, their private
                        interest, will not be an overmatch for their public?</p>
                    <p>I expect that this will never be the case—I proceed upon the supposition,
                        that the private interest is and always will be the predominant one—and it
                        is upon that very foundation that I erect a good government.</p>

                    <p>Windham must have supposed that men were born virtuous and vitious, as with

                            their fears. Indeed under a solicitous and attentive government, the

                        the people render the proposal of improvement absurd, it may be observed,
                        that—this is an argument in favour of the worst government as good as in
                        favour of the best. Were the people better than they are now in the time of
                        the Stewards [Stuarts]? No: but the government has been improved since their
                        time. The government of Morocco could not be improved—It is impossible there
                        ever can have been any improvement in government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Windham was very shallow not to reflect that if the people be bad, it is
                        the government which makes them. What is it that makes a people virtuous? It
                        is chiefly the esteem in which virtue is held. But what is the great power
                        which operates upon the distribution of esteem? Undoubtedly the institutions
                        of government. Who are the men, whose opinion most sways the opinion of
                        other men? The men in power. Who are the men in power? Are they the most
                        virtuous? What are the qualities by which they are made choice of? For their
                        riches and for their subserviency, their prostitution. Riches and
                        prostitution are the qualities rewarded. Therefore men pursue riches and
                        prostitution. Create such laws as will show virtue to be in <anchor
                            xml:id="cpb2scrap21vb"/>esteem, and you will have virtue. Institute a
                        government which holds virtue in contempt, and you will have a nation of
                        rogues. It is your legislation that gives encouragement to virtue or the
                        contrary. It is the tone of government which is the tone of the nation.—The
                        Romans that in the time of Scipio inhabited Rome—the Greeks that in the time
                        of Leonidas inhabited Sparta, by whom are they replaced—and by what
                        cause?</p>
                    <p>Chuse men to places for their virtue—not for charm, riches, or vice—and see
                        what esteem it will place virtue in.</p>
                    <p>A people always have the qualities that are in esteem, practically, among
                        themselves. If virtue is not in esteem, it is because the government is
                        carried on <emph>not</emph> by virtue. Whatever the government is carried on
                        by is infallibly esteemed. The greater esteem bestowed upon riches than
                        virtue is solely the work of the government and may be easily traced to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In the sense of Windham, which includes not the cases of misconduct
                        punishable by the laws, it is the popular sanction, that operates to make

                            the present Discontents</emph>, p. 5, Ed. 3rd, 1770. <note>In
                                <emph>Works</emph>, II 221: “Our ministers are of the opinion, that
                            the increase of our trade and manufactures, that our growth by
                            colonization and by conquest, have concurred to accumulate immense
                            wealth in the hands of some individuals; and this again being dispersed
                            among the people, has rendered them universally proud, ferocious and
                            ungovernable.”</note></p>
                    <p>But one part of Mr. Windham’s doctrine was always at war with another. The
                        people in insurrection—let them be in insurrection as much as they
                        please—are contemptible, not formidable. Who says so? Windham. Where? in his
                        argument for the regular army. That argument totally depends upon the truth
                        of that assumption. See too what he says expressly in favour of it,
                        Cobbett’s <emph>Parl. Debates</emph>, v. 6, p. [656]. “The people in mass,”
                        then said he, “are like metal in the ore; and as all the iron that ever come
                        from a Swedish mine would never hew a block or divide a plank, till it was
                        wrought and fashioned into the shape of a hatchet or a saw, so the strength
                        of a people can never perhaps, be made capable of producing much effect in
                        war, till it is extracted partially, and moulded into that factitious and
                        highly polished instrument, called an army.” <note>Debate on Mr. Windham’s

                        will render him most successful. If he sees that frankness, plain dealing;
                        disdain of baseness; courage, training, genius, are the qualities most
                        likely to gain the approbation of those who have favours to bestow, he will
                        recommend those qualities to his son. If he sees that wealth, that
                        hypocrisy, that servility, dishonesty, cunning, are most useful, he pushes
                        those qualities. If the patronage of government is distributed with a total
                        disregard to merit; merit will be despised. If the leading orders are

                    <p>The origin of the vices of which Windham complains, is the inordinate love of

                    <p>“For it is not so mischievous that men of high position do evil—though that
                        is bad enough in itself—as it is that these men have so many imitators. For,
                        if you will turn your thoughts back to our early history, you will see that
                        the character of our most prominent men has been reproduced in the whole
                        state; whatever change took place in the lives of the prominent men has also
                        taken place in the whole people. And we can be much more confident of the
                        soundness of this theory than that of our beloved Plato’s. For he thought
                        that the characteristics of a nation could be changed by changing the
                        character of its music. But I believe a transformation takes place in a
                        nation’s character when the habits and mode of living of its aristocracy are
                        changed. For that reason men of the upper class who do wrong are especially
                        dangerous to the State, because they not only indulge in vicious practices
                        themselves, but also infect the whole commonwealth with their vices; and not
                        only because they are corrupt, but also because they corrupt others, and do
                        more harm by their bad examples than by their sins. But this law, which
                        applies to the whole senatorial order, could be made even narrower in its
                        application. For a few men—very few, in fact—on account of their high
                        official position and great reputation, have the power either to corrupt the
                        morals of the nation or reform them.” [L] Cicero, <emph>de legibus,

                    <p>Discourse between a nobleman and Dr. Harrison—admirable for quotation—Dr.
                        Harrison insisting that men of merit should be employed—the noblemen calling
                        this Utopianism, and saying it was impossible—for reason, he makes use of
                        the argument, afterwards so ingeniously invented by Mr. Windham. “Do you not
                        know, doctor,” says he, “that this is as corrupt a nation as ever existed
                        under the sun? And would you think of governing such a people by the strict
                        principles of honesty and morality?”—“If it be so corrupt,” said the doctor,
                        “I think it is high time to amend it. … To deny a man the preferment which
                        he merits, and to give it to another man who doth not merit it, is a
                        manifest act of injustice; and is consequently inconsistent with both honour
                        and honesty. Nor is it only an act of injustice to the man himself, but to
                        the public, for whose good principally all offices [are], or ought to be,
                        instituted. Now this good can never be completed, nor obtained, but by
                        employing all persons according to their capacities. Wherever true merit is
                        liable to be superseded by favour and partiality, and men are entrusted with
                        offices, without any regard to capacity or integrity, the affairs of that
                        state will always be in a deplorable situation. Such, as Livy tells us, was
                        the state of Capua, a little before its final destruction; and the
                        consequence your lordship well knows. But, my lord, there is another
                        mischief which attends this kind of injustice; and that is, it hath a
                        manifest tendency to destroy all virtue and all ability among the people, by
                        taking away all that encouragement and incentive, which should promote
                        emulation, and raise men to aim at excelling in any art, science or
                        profession. Nor can any thing, my lord, contribute more to render a nation
                        contemptible among its neighbours. … And it was chiefly owing to the
                        avoiding of this error, that Oliver Cromwell carried the reputation of
                        England higher than it ever was at any other time.” Henry Fielding,

                    <p>What were the infringements by Pitt on the portion of liberty we enjoyed?</p>
                    <p>King of England has an interest in bad government—not only in what
                        contributes to the gratification of his own love of money, power, ease,
                        vengeance—but in what contributes to the gratification of the love of money,
                        power, ease, vengeance in all his subordinates—the more their situations
                        contribute to that gratification in all its shapes, the more their places
                        are worth—and the greater the value of the places the King has at his
                        disposal, the more his sinister interest in every one of its shapes is
                        advanced. Of the whole of his subordinates the King has an interest that
                        each or all of them should have the least possible capacity, and the least
                        possible probity—that is the least that is consistent with the submission of
                        the people—because the less the capacity in any situation requisite, and the
                        more that can be made of it, the more is the situation worth—as far as
                        little capacity is consistent with much getting in any situation, the less
                        the better—where the much getting depends on some degree of capacity, there
                        is a little struggle between those interests, which must as usual be
                        settled, by sacrificing a little on both sides.—This King’s interest in the
                        incapacity of his servants, has a feature peculiar to itself—that the most
                        incapable are naturally the most obsequious. This interest of the King in
                        having bad servants, a feature peculiar to a limited monarchy—where the King
                        is as much master of the public at large as of his immediate servants, [ it
                        is his interest that no one set should be allowed to plunder another.</p>
                    <p>Two means of creating dependence.—1. Fear.—2. Hope.—The first only looked to
                        by the vulgar eye.—The first the engine of rude times..—The latter not less
                        effectual—witness the clergy in England, Judge &amp; Co.—This instrument of
                        a polished age. <note>“Judge &amp; Co” is a Benthamite term of
                        abuse.</note></p>
                    <p>The King desires his ministers strong as against the people—weak as towards
                        himself. A plan, Burke says, begun with the present reign to have a weak
                        ministry—by proscribing the individuals who had great family and pecuniary
                        influence, as they who from talents, reputation of patriotism, had great
                        personal. The fiction of the double cabinet means merely this—a King who
                        desires his ministers should obey him—not he them. <note><emph>Thoughts on

                    <p>From Burke—<emph>Thoughts on the Causes of the present
                        Discontents.</emph>—The House of Commons, intended “as a
                            <emph>controul</emph>, issuing <emph>immediately</emph> from the people,
                        and speedily to be resolved into the mass whence it arose.”—The character of
                            <emph>citizen</emph>, thence, expected to prevail in its members over
                        that of magistrate.—Expected of them “to feel with a more tender and nearer
                        interest than others every thing that concerned the people.” In the
                        legislative part of government what juries [are] in the judicative..—“This
                        character can never be sustained, unless the House of Commons shall be made
                        to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the people at large. It
                        would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more natural and tolerable, that
                        the House of Commons should be infected with every epidemical phrensy [ of
                        the people […], than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by
                        the feelings and opinions of the people out of doors. By this want of
                        sympathy they would cease to be a House of Commons. For it is not the
                        derivation of the power of that house from the people, which makes it in a
                        distinct sense their representative. The King is the representative of the
                        people; so are the Lords; so are the Judges. They are all trustees for the
                        people as well as the commons; because no power is given for the sole sake
                        of the holder. … Its forms, and the persons who administer it, all originate
                        from the people.—A popular origin cannot therefore be, the characteristical
                        distinction of a popular representative. This belongs equally to all parts
                        of government <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap26v2"/>and in all forms. The virtue,
                        spirit and essence of a House of Commons consists in its being the express
                        image of the feelings of the nation. It was not instituted to be a controul
                            <emph>upon</emph> the people, as of late it has been taught, by a
                        doctrine of the most pernicious tendency. It was designed as a controul
                            <emph>for</emph> the people. Other institutions have been formed for the
                        purpose of checking popular excesses; and they are, I apprehend, fully
                        adequate to their object. If not, they ought to be made so. The House of
                        Commons, as it was never intended for the support of peace and
                        subordination, is miserably appointed for that service; having no stronger
                        weapon than its mace, and no better officer than its serjeant at arms, which
                        it can command of its own proper authority. A vigilant and jealous eye over
                        executory and judicial magistracy; an anxious care of public money, an
                        openness, approaching towards facility, to public complaint: these seem to
                        be the true characteristics of our House of Commons. But an addressing House
                        of Commons and a petitioning nation; a House of Commons full of confidence
                        when the nation is plunged in despair; in the utmost harmony with ministers,
                        whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the
                        public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant,
                        when the general voice demands account; who in all disputes between the
                        people and administration, presume against the people; who punish their
                        disorders, but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them; this is
                        an unnatural, a monstrous state of things in the constitution. … This change
                        [ from an immediate state of procuration and delegation to a course of
                        acting as from original power, is the way in which all popular magistracies
                        in the world have been perverted from their purposes. It is indeed their
                        greatest and sometimes their incurable corruption. … For my part, I shall be
                        compelled to conclude the principle of parliament to be totally corrupted,
                        and therefore its ends entirely defeated, when I see two symptoms: first, a
                        rule of indiscriminate support to all ministers; because this destroys the
                        very end of parliament as a controul, and is a general previous sanctions to
                        misgovernment: and secondly, the setting up any claims adverse to the right
                        of free election; for this tends to subvert the legal authority by which the
                        house of commons sits.” (pp. 67, 68, 69). <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>,
                            287-90.</note></p>
                    <p>“To carry the House of Commons to a total oblivion of its first principles
                        has been the great scheme of power in our time. They who will not conform
                        their conduct to the public good, and cannot support it by the prerogative
                        of the crown, have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the
                        shattered and old fashioned fortress of prerogative, and made a lodgement in
                        the strong hold of parliament itself. If they have any evil design to which
                        there is no ordinary legal power commensurate, they bring it into
                        parliament. In parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the
                        end. … Thus the controul of parliament upon the executive power is lost;
                        because parliament is made to partake in every considerable act of
                        government. Impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the
                        constitution, is in danger of being lost, even to the idea of it.”

                    <p>[ It is a common observation, that governments are made to provide against
                        the follies and vices of men. Therefore the doctrine of non-trust is at the
                        very foundation of all government. Nothing should be left upon trust. Trust
                        men in power is just as much as to say cherish bad government. If trust in
                        men of place and power be a good doctrine, then simple Despotism alone is
                        good government.—Every check that any government provides, is a declaration
                        of the non-trustworthiness of public men.</p>
                    <p>Is it true that the people of England have vested all power uncontrouled in

                        all. To abstain from acts of appropriation in regard to things, is unequally

                        situation in which they had contemplated themselves, have only derived the
                        miserable knowledge of sucking the blood of the people, a science in which
                        they wish to instruct the King for their own advantage.” Sully was a man
                        well acquainted with the common tribe of place-hunters. What miseries, in

                        of the King’s negative.—The dependence of the lords upon the king, enables

                        too much nor restrained too violently. The mind of man cannot be truly at
                        ease in either situation. In the first it runs rapidly down like a clock
                        without a pendulum, to steady and direct its motions. In the other, it is so
                        clogged with parts, that no weight or spring can move it.—The French seem to
                        have this happy medium. Their government, though called despotic by those
                        who understand it not, has just that kind of liberty which human nature, in
                        opulent societies, is able to bear—indulged in all that can reasonably make
                        the happiness of a nation; the monarch’s will enforcing no more than what
                        the laws of England stand in need of to put them in motion, and providing
                        expedients for the momentary restraints, which it is difficult to provide in
                        a mixt government, and yet which all governments want.—The inhabitants of
                        France being restrained from doing ill by laws and powers; the mind does not
                        contract that licentious habit of discontent which the manners of England
                        import by an universal indulgence. It enjoys [<emph>sic</emph> feels] its
                        state, being restrained by law and custom, with freedom sufficient to taste
                        freedom, and not sated with draughts of luscious licentiousness, which
                        intoxicate and efface the relish of all happiness.—This seems to me to be
                        the cause of the difference between the English and the French. And neither
                        winds nor rains, degrees of climate, diet or drink has made the dispositions
                        of the two nations.—The English, not free, but licentious, are discontented
                        in all things, and strangers to the joys of true social liberty.—The French,
                        more controuled by constitution, and free in social life, taste the true
                        sweets of liberty, which are to be found in living together. With a native
                        of the first—we are uncertain of his disposition for two hours together. Too
                        proud to indulge any one’s inclinations but his own, he becomes as unsocial
                        as an owl, as ominous, displeasing, and to be avoided.—With the other you
                        are sure of his temper. He is too polite to be changing momentarily like the
                        colours of a camelion, or the feathers of a pigeon’s neck, with every

                        many absolute Lords joining together to conquer other Nations, would not
                        enter into the Confederacy without such Privileges, as, might be marks of
                        Difference in Time following, between their Posterity, and the Posterity of
                        their Subjects; which Privileges being inconsistent with the Sovereign
                        Power, by the favour of the Sovereign, they may seem to keep; but contending
                        for them as their Right, they must needs by Degrees let them go, and have at

                            <del>interests</del> interest. That is to say of the good things of life
                        (whatever they may be, wealth, power, ease, etc.) it is the interest of
                        every member that as much as possible should belong to the community. But of
                        this portion belonging to the community (whatever it may be) it is the
                        interest of each individual that as great a share as possible should belong
                        to himself. That is the private interest of each individual; separate from,

                        good things desirable for the community, freedom is one—freedom of doing
                        what every body pleases. Has every individual an interest in this? Not in
                        the same sense, surely, as in the stock of wealth—there is no stock of

                        members into the Common’s House creates a union of interests between the two
                        houses, without which, the balance of opposing interests would produce
                        nothing but confusion.</p>
                    <p>Corollary. By the union of the two houses[?] as friends, the balance which

                    <p>Objection. Not entirely abolished, only so far as to produce harmony—there is
                        a mutual compromise.</p>
                    <p>How is the compromise brought about? Not by rendering the lords subservient
                        to the commons, but the commons subservient to the lords.</p>
                    <p>Suppose the steward and the butler, employed to check one another. And
                        suppose the steward to establish an harmony of interests between himself and

                    <p>To what extent, great or small, the interest of the lords operates in the

                    <p>It is in the power of government to contribute to this end, by contributing
                        to four subordinate ends: 1. Subsistence, 2. Abundance, 3. Equality, 4.
                        Security.</p>
                    <p>What are the elementary powers of Government? Answer: 1. The power of
                        punishing, 2. The power of rewarding.</p>
                    <p>To employ these powers in the best possible manner for 1. Subsistence 2.
                        abundance 3. equality 4. Security in the society, is the whole business of
                        government.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap28rb1"/>The end of government is the production of
                        happiness. A man’s happiness depends upon: 1. the state of his person, 2.
                        his state in regard to things, 3. his state in regard to his fellow
                        creatures.</p>
                    <p>1. That the persons of all the members of the community may be in the state
                        most productive of pleasurable sensations.</p>
                    <p>2. That of the things calculated to produce pleasurable sensations there may
                        be as great an abundance as possible.</p>
                    <p>3. That these things may be distributed in the way best calculated to
                        multiply agreeable sensations.</p>
                    <p>4. That the individuals of whom the community consist may be <del>so
                            connected</del> in such a state in regard to one another as to be
                        productive of the greatest amount of pleasures to one another.</p>
                    <p>1. In regard to persons the chief thing is to be guarded from injury, from
                        the production of pains. Security of person.</p>

                    <p>3. The distribution of property most conducive to pleasure, is the most
                        equal. Equality in regard to property.</p>
                    <p>4. The state most conducive to pleasure among individuals is the state of

                    <p>Executive power is the management of the public force.—Force requisite for 2
                        purposes: <del>1. Effectuation of Judicial ends</del>. <del>2. Defence
                            against external enemies</del> viz. <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap28rdv"/>1.
                        Force is applicable for the effectuation of legislative ends, 2. for defence
                        against foreign enemies.</p>
                    <p>The first, viz., legislative ends, are effected: 1. by Judicative means, 2.
                        without judicative means, and force is necessary occasionally for the
                        accomplishment of judicial means. the only <del>purpose</del> end of
                        legislation, not effecticable through judicial means, is the raising of the

                        is, the danger of subjecting the state to the absolute power of some potent
                        general; as it happened in Rome, Florence, and in England, in the late civil
                        war. For to lose even half the subjects in a war, is more tolerable than the
                        loss of liberty; since if liberty and good laws be preserved, an age or two
                        will repair the loss of subjects and improvements, though they be ever so
                        great. But if liberty be lost, it is never to be retrieved; but brings
                        certain and infallible destruction, as it did to Rome, and has brought in a
                        great measure to Florence, and will to England, if ever the prerogative do
                        swallow up the liberties and privileges of the subjects.—So far is it from
                        truth that the allowing of resistance in some cases of extremity has greater
                        inconveniences than absolute subjection.” Archbishop [William] King’s

                        miserable subjects. But I answer, there are some points [<emph>sic</emph>
                        cases] so plain, that they need no judge at all. Every man must be left to
                        judge for himself; and for his integrity, he must be answerable to God, and
                        his own conscience. Matters of fact are often of this nature, and I take
                        this to be one of them. For either the people must be left to judge of the
                        designs of their governor, by what they see and feel from him; or else they
                        must be obliged by a blind and absolute submission, without employing their
                        understandings in the case.—And I dare appeal to all the world, whether it
                        be safer to leave it to the judgements and consciences of a whole Kingdom to
                        determine concerning the designs of their governor; or to leave it to the
                        will and conscience of the King, whether he will destroy them. One of these
                        is unavoidable. And I am assured it is less probable, that the generality of
                        a kingdom will concur, in a mistake of this nature, and less mischievous if
                        they should mistake, than that a King, by weakness, wicked counsellors, or
                        false principles, should design to make his people slaves, subvert the
                        ancient government, or destroy one part of his people whom he hates, in

                        however the people may be separated or divided into small parties, either in
                        their votes or elections, their near habitation in a city will always make
                        the force of popular tides and currents very sensible. … In a large
                        government which is modelled with masterly skill, there is compass and room
                        enough to refine the democracy, from the lower people, who may be admitted
                        into the first elections, or first concoctions [<emph>sic</emph> concoction]

                        <emph>People would destroy property.</emph> The existence of property is
                        either useful to the people—the great body of mankind—or it is hurtful to
                        them, an instrument to benefit the few at the expense of the many, in other
                        words, a <del>thing</del> source of evil to human nature. I give you your
                        choice. Tell me which of the two conclusions you espouse. If that which
                        makes the existence of property an evil, you must <del>allow</del> grant
                        that it ought not to be allowed. <del>to exist</del> If the existence of
                        property is really useful to the great body of the evil [<emph>sic</emph>
                        people], we must not allow any body to tell us that the people cannot be
                        made to see the truth upon the subject. When pains are taken with the
                        people, they can be made to believe firmly things that are wholly contrary
                        to their interest, and very difficult to believe. This, by the concession,
                        is agreeable to their interest, and the chain of proof is a very short one.
                        Paley had the most perfect confidence in it. “The laws which accidentally
                        cast enormous riches into one great man’s possession, are, after all, the
                        self-same laws which protect and guard the poor man. … To abolish riches
                        would not be to abolish poverty: but, on the contrary, to leave it without
                        protection or resource. It is not for the poor man to repine at the effects
                        of laws and rules, by which he himself is benefited every hour of his
                        existence; which secure to him his earning, his habitation, his bread, his
                        life; without which he, no more than the poor [<emph>sic</emph> rich] man,
                        could either eat his meal in quietness, or go to bed in safety. Of the two,
                        it is rather more the concern of the poor to stand up for the laws, than of
                        the rich; for it is the law which defends the weak against the strong, the
                        humble against the powerful, the little against the great; and weak and
                        strong, humble and powerful, little and great, there would be, even were
                        there no laws whatever.” Paley, <emph>Reasons for Contentment, addressed to
                            the labouring part of the British Public, Sermons and Tracts</emph>, p.

                        the compass of thought can more deeply mark the perversion of the moral
                        faculty, than the avowal of a sentiment of this description. Yet how little
                        is it customary for military men to disguise it; or indeed for men in
                        general. It might be sufficient to appeal to every man’s experience. But
                        instead of a thousand instances which might be found upon record, we shall
                        select one. By the treaty formed by Lord Cornwallis with the Maharattas in
                        1790, it was stipulated that a detachment of the British army should act
                        with the Maharattas. This detachment was ordered from Bombay, and we have
                        received a most instructive account of its operations under the title of
                            <emph>A narrative of the operations of Captain Little’s
                            detachment</emph>, etc., by Edward Moore, Lieut. on the Bombay
                        Establishment. Lieut. Moore is so far from being an inferior man that the
                        work which we owe to him, stands in the very foremost rank of those which we
                        have yet received on Indian subjects. The following testimony, therefore,
                        has every quality which can render it respectable. “The destination of this
                        detachment was not generally known. Its embarkation, however, diffused a
                        great degree of satisfaction throughout Bombay. The military were elated at
                        the idea of being again employed; and the settlement, in general, from the
                        laudable wish, that its reputation might be increased, by a renewal of those
                        scenes in which the Bombay troops had ever borne so conspicuous and
                        honourable a part.” p. 1. Here, without any consideration of what the war
                        was to be about, the general prospect of war,—war, at any rate, was
                        delightful, he says, to the military first, and then to the whole
                        settlement. <note>1794, pp. 1-2.</note></p>

                            Reformation</emph> (P. I, ch. 1) thus:—“It is not difficult to
                        understand why those who were possessed of the government of the western
                        church in the days of our fathers, and those who have since succeeded them
                        in the church of Rome, have thought themselves so much concerned to oppose
                        the Reformation. It would oblige them to strip themselves of that sovereign
                        and absolute authority, which they had usurped, and by which they had
                        disposed the consciences of men to their wills; it would force them to give
                        an account of that public management which they held in their hands: And no
                        person is ignorant that of all things in the world this is most intolerable
                        to those persons who have made a secular empire of the government of the
                        church. As those interests have made them lay hold of all they could to
                        defend themselves, so they have raised a new controversy touching the right
                        that our fathers thus had to reform themselves. They demand of us who our
                        reformers were, from whence they came, and what call they had for so great a
                        work? They accuse them to have been rebels, and schismatics, who lifted
                        themselves up against the authority of their mother the Church, and broke
                        the sacred bond of the Christian communion. They have defamed their persons
                        as much as ever they could, and have laid to their charge the most wicked
                        manners, to the end they might render them odious. In fine, they have put
                        forward all that they could believe capable of retaining the people in a
                        blind submission, and hindering them from entering upon any examination of
                        the matters of religion.” <note>Jean Claude, <emph>An Historical Defence of

                        English clergyman at dinner—a well-bred man—and of agreeable conversation,
                        well acquainted with the ordinary parts of literature—but in politics and
                        religion, a bigot to things as they are. He affirmed that there was in the
                        low part of human nature a dislike of institutions. He affirmed that in this
                        country things are well as they are; and asked, when things are well, why
                        should not men be contented? He afterwards proceeded to predict all sorts of
                            <del>mischievous consequences as</del> crimes and calamities, as
                        necessarily about to flow from any attempt to improve our institutions.</p>
                    <p>I only observed that the distinguishing characteristic of man is, that he is
                        a progressive being—bid him trace the wonderful progress he has made—and
                        asked him, if he really wished to see him stop just where he was—or if he
                        did not allow that such was the practical consequence of his doctrine? I
                        might have gone on to tell him, that his <del>doctr position</del> axiom
                        about the hatred of institutions was a recognized error contrary to daily
                        experience—men are wedded to their habits and customs, in resistance of the
                        stronger impulse of reason. And then, as to your <del>observe</del>
                        affirmation that low people have a propensity to hate institutions, I
                        account this a very great violation of the rules of argumentation; this is
                        calling of names—which is so far from being proof, that it implies
                        destitution of proof, and a wish to carry the point, not by fair means but
                        by foul. I do not see what motive low people can have to dislike good
                        institutions, but I know well what motives high people may have, <del>to
                            speak and act as if they were</del> to be in love with bad. Supposing
                        they were low people, and low people only, that wished to see a door left
                        open to the improvement of the social order, would this imply they are
                        wrong? Who were they who first received the gospel?</p>
                    <p>On things as they are, the parson remarked that we stood high among the
                        nations, that in our parliament all interests were represented, learning,
                        property, etc.—On this I might have remarked, that when we dispute about the
                        excellence of any system of means, it is necessary first to see what we
                        contemplate as the end. If you will tell me what you regard as the ends of
                        government, I will tell you what I mean by them. Having agreed that it was
                        the greatest happiness of the greatest number, we then might proceed to our
                        parliament—and then I should affirm that every thing was represented but the
                        people. But as to the dogma things are best as they are, it may be observed
                        that they are either abstract perfection, or they are not.—If not, then is
                        it absurd to say, leave them as they are.—The man who defrauds me of an
                        estate which is coming to me, injures me equally with him who defrauds me of
                        one which I have.</p>
                    <p>The prediction of crimes and calamities. I wonder people do not observe, that
                        this is constantly done whenever any thing however good is proposed which a
                        man does not like. I applaud prudence however; you do well to recommend

                        mock resignation; and, by an appearance, at least, of honest resentment,
                        have acquitted himself of premeditated treachery.” Miss Seward’s

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap29rb4"/>The form of government is the source of
                        every thing which blesses the people of a state. Where they are unhappy in
                        the <del>construction of the</del> organ of management, (the dioikhsiw `lh)
                        [the entire management] it is not wonderful that their affairs, should be
                        managed ill. The accident of a man of good qualities, or of a turn of
                        fortune, may give a temporary prosperity; but in every period of a given
                        length evil will predominate. Good is not attached to strong walls, or a
                        great population, but to the right management of a people’s affairs: for the
                            <del>machine</del> soul of a state is its Politeia [Polity], having the
                        same power, as the understanding in the body; for it is this which
                        deliberates about every thing, which preserves what is good, and saves from
                        what is evil; to this the laws, the orators, and individuals, are of
                        necessity similar; and such as they have that, such are the actions of each.

                            ability in Greek, G. Norlin’s in the Loeb edition: “And it is to be
                            expected that acting as we do we should fare as we do; for nothing can
                            turn out well for those who neglect to adopt a sound policy for the
                            conduct of their government as a whole. On the contrary, even if they do
                            succeed in their enterprises now and then, either through chance or
                            through the genius of some man, they soon after find themselves in the
                            same difficulties as before; … we were not able to hold our good fortune
                            any time at all, but quickly dissipated and destroyed it. For we neither
                            possess nor do we honestly seek to obtain a policy which can properly
                            deal with our affairs. And yet we all know that success does not visit
                            and abide with those who have built around themselves the finest and the
                            strongest walls nor with those who have collected the greatest
                            population in one place, but rather with those who most nobly and wisely
                            govern the state. For the soul of a state is nothing else than its
                            polity, having as much power over it as does the mind over the body; for
                            it is this which deliberates upon all questions, seeking to preserve
                            what is good and to ward off what is disastrous; and it is this which of
                            necessity assimilates to its own nature the laws, the public orators,
                            and the private citizens; and all the members of the state must fare
                            well or ill according to the kind of polity under which they
                            live.”</note></p>

                        government, whatever be the stage of society, the government has always been
                        better, than any government in the same stage, without the people.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks and Romans, better than any other government in their age—though
                        they knew not the representative system. As soon as the people lost their
                        share, the Greek and Roman governments became horrid.</p>
                    <p>The Italian Republics and the free cities in Germany during the middle
                        ages.</p>
                    <p>The English government ever since the House of Commons had any power in the
                        state.</p>
                    <p>All the good there ever has been in any government under the sun has been
                        owing to the share the people had in it.</p>
                    <p>See the argument of the non-people men.—All the good that ever has been in
                        governments is owing to the share the people have had in them; therefore the
                        influence of the people in government is a thing always to be dreaded,
                        hated, and opposed. And so all the good that ever has been found in
                        government, has been gained by disproving this argument.</p>
                    <p>2. There was a time when the aristocrates, the nobles, were much more
                        ignorant as a body, than the people are as a body now. The aristocrates
                        carried on government then.—Ergo, say the aristocrates, the people for
                        ignorance, cannot have a share in the government now.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap29v1b"/>3. The aristocrates, as a body, are less
                        wise, less knowing, than the people, as a body, are now.—Take your young
                        squires, knights, and lords, and join to them the old ones, how many of them
                        do you find with understandings equal to their own house-keepers? Are they
                        fit for government?</p>
                    <p>Objection. Oh! but the unwise among them give way to the wise, and we are
                        governed by the best. Answer. If the least wise among them are governed by
                        the most wise, so it is among the people.</p>
                    <p>4. The people have in all ages been traduced and defamed. That portion of
                        mankind who wish to have another person under their feet have always
                        represented them as unworthy to be in any other situation than under their
                        feet. This is to be done by representing them as made up of two sorts of
                        qualities, one hateful, the other dangerous. The Aristocrates and the
                        priests are the persons who have always had this interest; and have always
                        followed this course. And nothing ever has been done for mankind, which they
                        have not opposed on the ground of the hateful, and dangerous qualities of
                        the people. So they opposed the reformation, the power of chusing their
                        religion would be mischievous in the people. So they opposed the erection of
                        schools—education would be mischievous in the people. So the West India
                        aristocrates, the slave owners, opposed the abolition—it would put
                        mischievous ideas in their minds.</p>

                    <p>6. May the people be trusted now? We say, that upon those who deny it rests
                        the burthen of proof. Doubtless the people are to be trusted, unless where
                        it can be shewn that evil would result from it. This is a primary
                        proposition, altogether beyond the reach of dispute. That the common affairs
                        of any number of people should be managed by them all (where no special
                        reason exists to exclude any one or more) will not be denied.
                            <emph>All</emph> the people, therefore, are to be admitted, where no
                        special reason is shewn. It is for them therefore who would exclude to
                        produce their reasons; and to <emph>prove</emph> why the people should be
                        excluded.</p>
                    <p>That no good reason has ever yet been shewn, I am ready to prove. Bold,
                        arrogant assumptions of the point in dispute are not proof. Calling of
                        names, and foul language is not proof. When any thing is attempted to be
                        proved by these, it is a proof that it has no proof.</p>
                    <p>That the French revolution produced excesses is no proof. By the same
                        reasoning the excesses of Nero, of Philip II, of Henry VIII, of Frederic the
                        Great, of Louis XIV, of Robespierre, of Napoleon, would prove that all
                        government is bad: the massacre of St. Bartholomew, etc., that all religion
                        is bad.</p>

                        is against you. Explore the history of mankind from its beginning to its
                        end. You will not find one example of the hostility of the people to
                        property, or the owners of property. Explore it from beginning to end, you
                        will find a constant course of veneration for and obedience to the owners of
                        property.</p>
                    <p>The few are friends of good government. The many are enemies to it. Answer.
                        This is impossible; for the interests of both are opposite to what you
                        affirm of them.</p>

                        should they obey when government is hurtful to them—disobey when it is

                        the holding of any portion of power—the moral, and the intellectual. Unless
                        the moral is laid as foundation, the intellectual is only power to do
                        mischief.—The people have the moral complete; and where the moral is
                        complete, a moderate portion of the intellectual sufficient.</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap29v3"/>“The powerful distinction in the United
                        States is that of poor and rich. The poor, being more numerous, are, by the
                        virtue of the universality of suffrage, the sovereign, whom government must
                        obey or be dismissed. The rich are naturally an object of jealousy to the
                        poor, particularly when neither birth, nor scarcely any other superiority,
                        softens the inequality, and renders it respectable. Therefore the measures
                        of government must be unfavourable to the rich; that is, to commerce, the
                        only road to wealth in the United States. It is observed, that almost any
                        individual who becomes wealthy enters <emph>ipso facto</emph> the ranks of
                        opposition, and <emph>vice versa</emph> those of fallen fortunes. Talents
                        are to be found in opposition to government in America as in England,
                        because it is the brilliant side; but wealth in England is arrayed on the
                        side of government, with whom it feels safe, while in America it feels the
                        ill-will of a government dependent on the poor, and seeks the protection of
                        the talents in the opposition. A little more poverty in the multitude, and
                        property will fall an easy prey by such means as an income-tax assessed
                        arbitrarily by commissioners in support of any popular measures,—by the
                        establishment of a national paper money,—by a maximum perhaps. The
                        insecurity of property will then operate, as it has done every where, in
                        Turkey, in Persia, for instance, and, in a less degree, in those parts of
                        Europe, where the government could raise arbitrary taxes on industry, and
                        where the administration of justice was dependent.” Simond, <emph>Journal of
                            a Tour and Residence in Great Britain, in 1810, 1811</emph>, v. 2, p.
                        388. This passage is [of] importance, by a Frenchman, who had lived 20 years
                        in the United States. There is here indicated a constant effect of the rich,
                        to make the government oligarchical. This is paralleled by what was
                        perpetually experienced in the republics of Greece—where the rich were able,
                        by the rude construction of the republic, to make a constant of struggle,
                        and a frequent state of confusion.</p>
                    <p>“I am convinced on the testimony of persons on whom I rely perfectly, […]
                        that a decided improvement of <emph>domestic</emph> morals has taken place
                        in France during the revolution, notwithstanding the utmost depravity of
                        political morals.” Simond, <emph>ut supra</emph>, v. II, p. 496. This fact
                        is of the utmost importance, so attested. Mr. Simond, is a man highly
                        partial to oligarchical, monarchical government; and an abhorer of the
                        revolution. The people [illegible line] of the same stamp. The fact may,
                        therefore, be taken as undoubted. And it is a fact which proves that a
                        better government has existed.</p>
                    <p>On the passage, on the other side, many important remarks present themselves.
                        One, for memory’s sake, I mention. He says that if the people of the United
                        States, were to grow poorer, they would oppress the rich. How foolish! In
                        proportion as they become poorer, they would become more independent of
                            [<emph>sic</emph> dependent on] the rich. One of the best founded
                        arguments against universal suffrage is—that the population of Great Britain
                        being in excess, and therefore miserably poor, are not to be trusted with
                        the suffrage, being the slaves of the rich. <note>Louis Simond,

                        foundation of all laws.—I mean the law of self-defence; the law which is
                        always in force; <del>either</del> the law which occupies the ground, as
                        often as another law either does not exist, or is contrary to that law. The
                        law of self-defence existed when no other law existed: and all the ground
                        which is not occupied by other law it continues to occupy. The law of
                        self-defence is only renounced when a better law is provided—as often then
                        as a better is not provided, the law of self-defence returns. Does it not
                        return against the man who destroys as far as in him lies, the benefit of
                        those laws, which supersede the use of self-defence? “Believing that those
                        who are manifestly unrighteous and those who are plainly traitors and

                        first to ascertain the end, at which you drive. If it is the good of men, at
                        large—or if it is some other good. If it is the good of mankind, it is not

                        about the means; and in particular, when we talk about government, which is
                        the most distinguished of the means.</p>
                    <p>“A simple monarchy would be despotism and tyranny: A simple oligarchy, but
                        the tyranny of one association, instead of the tyranny of an individual; and
                        a simple democracy scarcely above anarchy.” (Mitford, <emph>Hist. of

                        three kinds of government only: democracy, aristocracy, monarchy. The
                        oligarchy is not a diverse form of government distinct from aristocracy, nor

                        non-resistance, and its contrary, constitute the most material difference
                        between Whigs and Tories. This great and delicate question is presented
                        under a simple and luminous point of view, by a modern English writer of
                        much reputation, (Paley). The idea of a social compact is, he says, a
                        fiction; such a compact never existed; and supposing the first generation of
                        men to have agreed upon one among themselves, it was not obligatory on the
                        succeeding generation. Every individual comes into the world with all his
                        natural rights unalienated, and, strictly speaking, is not obliged to obey
                        laws he did not make. It is, however, expedient to obey the laws which are
                        found ready established, and which cannot well be revised and confirmed by
                        every individual of each succeeding generation. This expediency ceases, when
                        the order of things violates the safety, the liberty, and the well-being of
                        the people; and here begins legitimate resistance,—but who is to determine
                        the expediency? Who is to judge of the fitness of resistance? Paley
                        answers,—Every man for himself at his peril! This is bold no doubt, and,
                        although true, might seem to prove too much at first sight, for, if
                        resistance is successful, it becomes legitimate, praise-worthy and glorious,
                        and if it does not succeed, it is criminal, and deserves the gallows. This
                        leads to a distinction between moral and political legitimacy. It is
                        expedient that revolutionists should suffer for their ill success <emph>in
                            terrorem</emph>, or there would be too many revolutions. […] The new
                        order of things once established should be maintained, if it secures the
                        happiness of the people, without any reference to the means by which it was
                        produced; for the punishment of the Usurper might fall on the people, and
                        lead to new violence and enormities. Corneille approached without suspecting
                        it, the expression of the above just and liberal sentiments, in the
                        following lines of Cinna, dictated as they are by the most servile

                    <p>A mixt monarchy is a mere fiction, provided for the deception of those who
                            <del>want to conceal the existence</del> dislike the idea of arbitrary
                        power. That it cannot exist is proved as follows. <del>The origin of all
                            polity is the consent of the greater number</del> The end of all polity
                        is the security of the individuals of whom the society consists. The
                            <del>instrument</del> chief instrument <del>of procuring that</del> for
                        attaining that security is the power of punishing. The power of punishing
                        must therefore be lodged somewhere. But it is capable of proof, that the
                        power of punishing cannot be divided. If you suppose that part of the power
                        of punishing is confided to <del>the King (monarchy ), part to the
                            aristocracy, part to the Democracy</del> a monarch, part to an
                        aristocratical, part to a democratical assembly, can you point out the
                        parts? The power of punishing may be so divided as that one of these organs
                        may have the power of punishing one part of the people; another, another. Or
                        it may be so divided that one may have the power of punishing in one degree,
                        another in another degree.</p>
                    <p>If one has the power of punishing one part of the people; another, another;
                        the one that has the power of punishing the greater number will prevail over
                        the rest, and unite the whole power; or if they are all equal, they will
                        fight till one gets the ascendant.</p>
                    <p>If one has the power of punishing in one degree, another in another degree;
                        the one that has the power of punishing in the greater degree is the master,
                        and the other acts only by sufferance.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap30v1b"/>If any body should make another supposition
                        that one of <del>these</del> two organs should have the power of determining
                        who shall be punished, and in what degree, the other have the power of
                        inflicting the punishments, it is evident that this latter is no power at
                        all—it is only service—rendered to the organ that determines.</p>
                    <p>Another supposition is, that of the three organs above described, no one
                        shall have the power of determining who shall be punished, or in what
                        degree, without the consent of the other’s. They will agree to punish all
                        acts which are hurtful in common to all. But the monarch will refuse to
                        punish acts, <del>useful</del> though hurtful to the other two, <del>not
                            hurtful</del> which are useful to himself; <del>and curb</del> the
                        aristocratical assembly will refuse to punish acts hurtful to the other two,
                        but useful to its members; the democratical assembly will refuse to punish
                        acts hurtful to the other two, but useful to its members. So many hurtful
                        acts will <del>thus</del> go unpunished, that the ends of government must
                        thus be very imperfectly attained. All acts hurtful to the democracy, useful
                        to the monarchy and aristocracy will go unpunished. Thus the members of the
                        democracy will suffer. All acts hurtful to the aristocracy, useful to the
                        democracy and monarchy, will go unpunished; thus the members of the
                        aristocracy will suffer. And in like manner, in his turn, the monarch will
                        suffer.</p>
                    <p>Suppose, instead of this unlimited opposition, they should make a compromise;
                        i.e., a limited opposition, and should <del>agree</del> allow each that
                        certain acts <del>hurtful to each to</del> useful to itself should be
                        punished, that certain other <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap30v1c"/>acts
                            <del>useful</del> hurtful to itself, but <del>hurtful</del> useful to
                        the rest should be punished also; it is evident that, allowing this project
                        practicable, it is still a contrivance for retaining a portion of evil. But
                        what is certain is, that when <del>one has to sacrifice a</del> a party is
                        required for the sake of a compromise, to sacrifice a portion of its
                        interests to one party, and a part to another, it will gain, if it can
                        arrange the matter with one and exclude the other. Where these parties
                            <del>thus</del> are concerned, <del>it is always</del> in sharing any
                        advantages, it is always the interest of two of them to combine against the
                        third. The power of punishing is a grand advantage, it cannot, therefore, be
                        shared by compromise among three. If the democracy combines with the
                        monarchy, they exclude the aristocracy; or with the aristocracy, the
                        monarchy. <del>In either of these cases, the third organ or interest, the
                            monarchical or aristocrats. But</del> If on the other hand, the monarchy
                        combines with the aristocracy, they usurp all power over the people. If the
                        monarchy or aristocracy joins with the people, the aristocracy in the first
                        case, the monarchy in the second, will be wholly put down. Thus the
                        compromise is to be adjusted between the king, and the people, or the
                        aristocracy and the people. <del>If</del> In both cases, if they are of
                            <del>equal</del> unequal strength, the weak will go down; if they are of
                        equal strength they will fight, till one of them is overcome. It follows
                        however very evidently from the principles of human nature, that the
                        monarchy must always, where obstructions are not very great, combine with
                        the <del>monarchy</del> aristocracy against the people. Unless where the
                        monarch can hope, after prevailing over the aristocracy by means of the
                        people, <anchor xml:id="cpb230v1d"/>[to] prevail next over the people
                        themselves, his only chance for existence is by combining with the
                        aristocracy. When a combination is made between the monarchy and
                        aristocracy, the people are not destroyed, they are only held in subjection.
                        They are powerless, as long as the monarchy and aristocracy are combined. If
                        the aristocracy and monarchy should contend, the people would render
                        superior that with which they should join. They cannot quarrel without
                        bringing the people into play, and this they apprehend would be the
                        destruction of them both. Wherever three interests, the monarchical,
                        aristocratical, and democratical exist, this, then is the natural
                            <del>state</del> position <del>and form</del> of things; and with this
                        deduction the whole experience of history <del>most minutely amazingly
                            agrees</del> in a wonderful manner coincides. The power of determining
                        who shall be punished is the most important part of legislation. The rest of
                        that power must go with the rest; because commands without the power of
                        enforcing obedience are folly. The power of making war must be in the same
                        hands, because without the power of punishing, how can you force people to
                        contribute either their purses or persons to your wars? The power of
                        appointing public servants must belong to the same, because without
                        punishment you have no security for good service.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is proved that a government composed of a mixture of the three simple
                        kinds cannot exist. “But if it were possible that there could be such a
                        state, it would no whit advantage the liberty of the subject. For as long as
                        they all agree, each single citizen is as much subject as possibly he can
                        be: but if they disagree, the state returns to a civil war and the right of
                        the private sword.” [L] Hobbsii, <emph>De cive</emph>, VII, § 4. <note>In

                            Seditious Meetings Bill, on the 17 Dec. 1819</emph></p>
                    <p>“Earl GROSVENOR said, he should be obliged to detain their lordships longer
                        on this occasion than he had done during the progress of other measures
                        connected with the present through that house, because he conceived the bill
                        of infinite importance, tending as it did to a radical alteration in the
                        frame of government. The noble earl near him (Lord Donoughmore) had called
                        on the noble lords opposite to exempt Ireland from the operation of this
                        act. That country had been represented by ministers, and by all who had
                        delivered their sentiments on this subject, as being in a state of perfect
                        quietness; and therefore he thought it should not be affected by such a
                        measure. But the noble lord [Earl of Harrowby] who had just sat down,
                        declared that the bill was a favour and a boon to the people of Ireland. How
                        far he would extend that favour and that boon, he could not say. Was it to
                        be extended to the settlements abroad? There were one or two places to which
                        perhaps ministers might suppose their favours would peculiarly apply. Would
                        they extend them to the Cape of Good Hope, to which they were exporting so
                        large a proportion of the population of the country? Would they also extend
                        them to the inhabitants of Botany Bay? The noble lord had congratulated
                        himself, and those around him, on the overwhelming majorities by which the
                        measures of ministers were supported. <hi rend="underline">If great
                            majorities always proved the truth</hi>, then indeed would the
                        excellence of the system now introduced by decidedly made out, and <hi
                            rend="underline">ministers might be considered as the best and wisest of
                            all human beings</hi>. But in the course of his own experience he had
                        found, in one or two cases, that <hi rend="underline">positions, supported
                            by overwhelming majorities, were in the course of six months afterwards
                            overturned</hi>. (Hear, hear.) Therefore he inferred, that great
                        majorities were not always an undeniable proof of the excellence of
                        measures; and he doubted very much whether, in this case, the large and <hi
                            rend="underline">overwhelming majorities by which ministers were
                            supported would be a satisfactory answer</hi> to those who viewed the
                        measures under consideration with distrust and suspicion. (Hear, hear.) The
                        noble earl rejoiced in the effect which the introduction of these measures
                        of coercion already had throughout the country. He stated his belief that it
                        was owing to them that the late meeting at Manchester passed off without
                        mischief. He felt very differently. In his opinion, <hi rend="underline"
                            >those measures were likely to excite discontent</hi>—to excite a <hi
                            rend="underline">strong feeling of indignation</hi> in the minds of the
                        people, instead of producing good humour and quietness. The noble lord spoke
                        of an army at Manchester—he spoke of an army at Glasgow; but if a military
                        force were thus employed in every part of the country, must not the
                        inference be, that these meetings were put an end to by violence, and not by
                        the operation of the law? (Hear, hear.) Instead of curing the evil, would it
                        not render it necessary to keep on foot, in a time of peace, still more
                        immense armies? <hi rend="underline">It was not by measures such as
                            these</hi>—it was not by means of violence and oppression—it was not by
                        employing large armies—<hi rend="underline">that the people would become
                            quiet and contented</hi>. It was by measures of conciliation, and not by
                        acts of violence, that the affections of the people were to be won. Those
                        who proceeded in a different course would, in the end, perceive that it led
                        to results very different from those which they expected. The noble earl had
                        adverted to <hi rend="underline">the French revolution—a subject perhaps too
                            much touched upon</hi>. If it could at all be quoted with effect, it
                        went to prove that <hi rend="underline">by timely conciliation</hi>, and not
                        by violence, the feelings of the people were likely to be soothed. (Hear.)
                        Previous to the French revolution, <hi rend="underline">meetings of numerous
                            bodies of the people were prohibited; they were put down by force; and
                            this was one of the causes that occasioned that great convulsion</hi>.
                        The noble earl said, that meetings of disaffected persons had lately taken
                        place to an extent that could not, without running the risk of great danger,
                        be any longer allowed. Let their lordships, in answer to this assertion,
                        look at the meetings in Yorkshire, and other places. They might there see
                        that persons of large property, as well as those who felt the severe
                        pressure of the times, assembled together. Did the noble earl really mean to
                        say that meetings of this sort were never to take place? Did he mean to
                        declare that persons of this description were never to be heard—that they
                        were never to discuss points of grievance, except when the meetings
                        consisted of certain numbers? Were they surprised, could they be astonished,
                        at the meetings that had recently been held in Yorkshire, and in other
                        districts, when they considered the impoverished state of the country? If
                        the country was, as all persons must acknowledge, in a state of distress and
                        suffering, was it not likely that persons who were affected by the pressure
                        of the times, would meet in large bodies, for the purpose of petitioning?
                        Were they, because those individuals were affected by distress—were they, he
                        demanded, to turn short on them and say, “No! you shall not meet, because
                        you are poor! you shall not meet because you are that portion of the people
                        who are most likely to be distressed! you shall suffer, but you shall not
                        have the privilege of complaining?” The people were now in circumstances
                        essentially different from those in which they had heretofore been
                        placed—they were oppressed by circumstances which formerly did not molest
                        them. The mode proposed by ministers was not the fair way of meeting the
                        circumstances of the time—it was not the just way of viewing the
                        question—since the people were now in a situation that was never before
                        thought of. He thought the power now vested in magistrates was quite
                        sufficient for every useful purpose, while, at the same time, it was
                        completely consistent with the rights and liberties of the subject. The bill
                        then before the house did, on the contrary, fritter away the rights of the
                        subject; and when it was passed, it was easy to see that no meetings would
                        be called except such as would enter into resolutions complimentary to
                        ministers. It would be well for them to take care, while they were
                        endeavouring to shun the rock of democracy, that they did not split on the
                        quicksand of arbitrary power. The increase of their military establishment
                        was one of the most appalling features of the new system. They had at
                        present an army of 20,000 men, which cost the country £4,000,000 a year, and
                        to that force a large addition was about to be made. (Hear, hear.) Were the
                        finances of the country capable of supporting such a burden? Were not the
                        finances, on the contrary, in such a state as rendered it impossible to bear
                        this additional expense? Did not they see the yeomanry cavalry rising in all
                        parts of the country? Were they not sufficient to preserve the peace, if a
                        military force were at all wanted? Did not one troop of cavalry disperse the
                        meeting at Manchester? (Hear, hear.) It would be well worth their while to
                        consider, whether the danger was not increased by the proceedings that took
                        place in the north. He would not say much more, because he should have other
                        opportunities of considering the general nature of all those measures; but
                        he must observe, that <hi rend="underline">he certainly was not one of those
                            who approved of the system which was acted on towards the people</hi>,—a
                        system which, throughout its whole progress, betrayed an utter contempt for
                        conciliation. He was a friend to wise and salutary regulations, but not to
                        such measures as those now proposed. They ought to take care that they did
                        not agree to measures, which the ultra zeal of some, which the mistaken
                        warmth of others, which the strong statement of a pestilent informer, might
                        turn into engines of the worst oppression. It was their duty to devise the
                        best means for correcting any thing that was wrong in the frame of society;
                        but they ought to be cautious lest while they were rooting out the poisonous
                        herbs, they did not destroy the useful plants which flourished next them.
                            <hi rend="underline">He believed that no bad spirit existed in the
                            country; he did not think that a bad spirit had been generated by
                            political causes</hi>. He was of opinion, contrary to what many noble
                        lords asserted, that <hi rend="underline">an evil revolutionary spirit did
                            not prevail throughout the kingdom</hi>. If he believed that such a
                        spirit was in existence—if he imagined that a bad feeling towards the
                        constitution was operating throughout the country, he would not be found
                        debating about this bill or that. If a revolutionary spirit was manifested,
                        he would at once endeavour to subdue it. In his opinion no spirit of the
                        kind existed. If there ever was a period when <hi rend="underline">the minds
                            of the people were more particularly enlightened than they ever before
                            were</hi>—if there ever was a period when they were more deeply
                        impressed with the purity of the great precepts of the Christian religion
                        than they had ever previously been, it was the time in which he was
                        speaking. (Hear.) He knew no case in which juries had not conscientiously
                        performed their duty. The case of Hone had often been adverted to. He
                        referred their lordships to that case, as proof of the truth of what he
                        asserted. The jury, he was convinced, viewed the pamphlets which the
                        individual was prosecuted for publishing, as matters of a political nature,
                        and therefore they acquitted him of any intention to revile the Christian
                        religion. Again, if they considered the case of Carlile, they would see that
                        the jury acted justly. They decided as every religious man must have wished
                        them to decide—as every honest man must have rejoiced that they did
                        decide—against that individual. To prove still further the feelings by which
                        the people were actuated, he begged leave to mention the way in which a
                        posthumous work, ‘the bones of Thomas Paine,’ had been treated in this
                        country. (Hear, hear.) Was there ever any subject treated with more
                        laughter, contempt, and derision, than the introduction of those miserable
                        bones—whether the bones of Tom Paine, or not, he would not undertake to
                        decide. (A laugh.) From every circumstance which had come under his
                        observation, he had a right to contend, that there was nothing in the
                        present state of affairs, that there was nothing in the feelings of the
                        people, nothing in the frame of society, had called for such bills as those
                        which were now under consideration. Measures of this nature did not bend to
                        the security of the subject, but gave rise to one general feeling of
                        suspicion and distrust. Where was the danger that threatened the country at
                        this moment? For his own part, he could not perceive where it existed.
                        (Hear, hear.) They all knew that mankind were surrounded with dangers. For
                        intance, <hi rend="underline">they could not tell but that meteoric stones
                            might fall on their heads as they passed through the streets</hi>. They
                        did not, however, on account of such a remote possibility, <hi
                            rend="underline">live always in a state of fear</hi>; neither would he
                        consent that <hi rend="underline">severe coercive measures should be put in
                            force, because ministers were apprehensive of dangers</hi> from the
                        foment of popular feeling. He believed that there were dangers of another
                            sort—<hi rend="underline">dangers meditated against the
                            constitution</hi>, which it would be well for the legislature to guard
                        against. They were told of persons who wished to overturn the present state
                        of things. Some of them were, in derision, called Radicals. What, he would
                        ask their lordships, did the conduct of these people proceed from? It might
                        be traced entirely to their distress, out of which discontent and
                        dissatisfaction had naturally grown. There were various causes to which that
                        distress might be attributed, although those persons declared it was
                        entirely the fault of the legislature. They stated that it would be
                        peculiarly proper that the voice of the people should be more distinctly
                        heard in the House of Commons. Then, they argued, there will be a better
                        chance of real efforts being made for the benefit of the people, and that a
                        reduction would be effected in the expenditure of the country, which was now
                        weighing heavily on all ranks of society. He believed, <hi rend="underline"
                            >if the wishes of the people were fairly met and considered</hi>, if
                        their claims were attended to, instead of being opposed by measures of this
                        kind, <hi rend="underline">that the whole mass of the population would be
                            conciliated</hi>, not even excepting those radicals of whom ministers
                        appear to be so much afraid. He was convinced that whatever danger
                        threatened the country was not lessened by the events of the 16<hi
                            rend="sup">th</hi> of August. It appeared clear to him, on the contrary,
                        that the conduct of the magistrates on that occasion greatly increased the
                        peril. When the meeting was dispersed <hi rend="underline">the people
                            endeavoured to obtain legal redress</hi>, but they were in the end
                        satisfied that they <hi rend="underline">could not procure justice</hi>.
                        Then came their last, their only hope, <hi rend="underline">that justice
                            would be done to them in Parliament</hi>—that there their case would be
                        sifted to the bottom, that there their grievances would be properly
                        redressed. In that hope they were most grossly deceived: <hi
                            rend="underline">they were deceived because it was not found convenient
                            for ministers to undertake such an investigation</hi>. He believed that
                        if the transactions of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of August were inquired
                        into, it would be found that the whole was a matter of police—an affair that
                        lay entirely between the police and the home department. It would be found
                        that the persons employed by the police on that occasion, under what
                        immediate direction he could not say, were the first to create tumult and
                        alarm. What did the principal officer do on that occasion? He proceeded to
                        execute his warrant, and when he came near the crowd that surrounded the
                        platform, which he described to be so close that he could not get through
                        it, he immediately returned and called for military force; whereas he (Lord
                        Grenville [<emph>sic</emph> Grosvenor]) contended, that the officer ought,
                        in conjunction with the constables, to have endeavoured to open his way to
                        the hustings. He did not, however, struggle to get through the press of the
                        people. He retired without making an effort, and then stated to the
                        magistrates that it was necessary to employ military force. He could prove,
                        if necessary, at their lordships’ bar, that long after the removal of those
                        unfortunate persons who were wounded and mangled on that melancholy
                        occasion—and he begged to say that this was the evidence of those upon whom
                        he could most implicitly rely—a large crowd collected round the hospital to
                        which they had been conveyed, anxious to inquire as to the fate and the
                        sufferings of their friends and relatives; and whilst they so stood near the
                        hospital gates, a party of yeomanry cavalry rode over, and injured many of
                        them. Much exaggeration appeared to have discoloured the statements which
                        their lordships had heard, relative to the many thousands of men who were
                        said to have been under arms. He had the satisfaction, on the other hand, of
                        stating to their lordships, that a great number of county meetings had been
                        held, at which resolutions had been agreed to, abundantly testifying the
                        loyalty of those who subscribed them. As to these “loyal meetings” as they
                        were called, they always appeared to him to be, to say the least, very
                        insipid meetings, for those who did not join in the resolutions were
                        considered as of course disloyal. They had the further disadvantage, that
                        they were very impolitic things; as in the case of another set of
                        resolutions—not that originally proposed, being carried by, as it might
                        happen, “an overwhelming majority.” At a late meeting of this sort, certain
                        resolutions of so very strong a character were moved, that it was found
                        impossible to pass them; several others were proposed, and a gentleman
                        observed, that the least which could be done with those who refused to
                        support such loyal resolutions, would be to transport them (a laugh);
                        another gentleman declared, that while he could not approve of those which
                        had been first submitted, he was ready to sign any declaration whatever. (a
                        laugh.) A noble lord had declared, that he felt more alarm at the
                            “<emph>vultus instantis tyranni</emph>” [the face of the tyrant that
                        threatens] than at the “<emph>civium ardor prava jubentium</emph>”. [the
                        enthusiasm of citizens who order perverse things.] For his own part he could
                        not help observing to their lordships, that <hi rend="underline">when they
                            looked at our foreign allies</hi>, and remarked the close and near
                        connexion which subsisted between this government and governments abroad,
                        they must view <hi rend="underline">with indignation and astonishment</hi>,
                        and at the same time with distrust, <hi rend="underline">the ingratitude of
                            those powers who had promised</hi>, in their hour of adversity, free and
                        representative government to a valiant people; but who, in their season of
                        prosperity, <hi rend="underline">had forgotten to redeem their sacred
                            pledge</hi>. (Hear, hear.) What were they to think when they saw <hi
                            rend="underline">governments alarmed at the diffusion of knowledge, and
                            hostile even to the practice of those gymnastic exercises</hi> in
                        schools and villages, which had always been considered the best adapted to
                        the improvement of the strength and spirit of mankind? What were they to
                        think of our own government, when they saw them <hi rend="underline"
                            >assisting the coast</hi> [<emph>sic</emph> court] <hi rend="underline"
                            >of Spain in all its measures of tyranny</hi> and oppression; when they
                        looked at the horrible state of that devoted country, and saw her bravest
                        patriots, with Arguelles at their head, (hear, hear,) chained in dungeons
                        and languishing in darkness? When their lordships beheld those brave and
                        noble champions of freedom, of whom their country should have been proud to
                        boast, and each of whose little fingers should have been more dear than the
                        whole flesh and sinews of their oppressor, tortured by a man who had once so
                        noble a part to take; and who might, in the moment of his restoration to the
                        throne of his ancestors, have given to his people a glorious constitution;
                        when they beheld <hi rend="underline">this close, this intimate connexion
                            subsisting between him and his Majesty’s ministers</hi>; and, above all,
                        when they coupled this last circumstance with the exertions made to pass the
                        foreign enlistment bill, (hear, hear,) they could not but concur with him
                        (Lord Grosvenor) in thinking that there was <hi rend="underline">more of the
                                “<emph>vultus instantis tyranni</emph>” in the government of the
                            country, than of the “<emph>civium ardor prava jubentium</emph>” in the
                            spirit of the people.</hi> (Hear, hear.) But most especially when they
                        adverted to <hi rend="underline">France, the only free nation of the
                            Continent</hi>, and, <hi rend="underline">as he feared</hi>, it would
                        very speedily prove, <hi rend="underline">in Europe</hi>, and found, that
                        immediately upon the return of the Duke of Richelieu to it from the
                        Congress, measures were adopted tending to destroy, or at least, to restrict
                        the existing state of things there as regarded political liberty, <hi
                            rend="underline">it was impossible not to anticipate the greatest
                            dangers to our own political liberty</hi>. (Hear.) He would refer their
                        lordships to some of the features which the internal policy of the
                        government exhibited to the attempts made for the renewal of the income tax;
                        the suspension of the <emph>Habeas Corpus</emph>; the enormous military
                        establishment maintained in time of profound peace; and particularly to one
                        act, on behalf of one of its members, which had done more harm to the Royal
                        Family than any other measure he could remember, however unadvised; and he
                        would then ask their lordships, whether they were not far more strongly
                        impressed with the “<emph>vultus instantis tyranni</emph>,” than with the
                            “<emph>civium ardor prava jubentium</emph>”? He had one word to say upon
                        a subject of very deep importance—the distresses of the people. (Hear.) Now
                        it had been always said by the noble lords opposite that <hi
                            rend="underline">they were not to blame if, the people were
                            distressed</hi>. It was not less remarkable, that if any appearance of
                            <hi rend="underline">prosperity manifested itself</hi> in any part of
                        the country, the same noble lords directly <hi rend="underline">took to
                            themselves the credit of it</hi>. Why, then, it was but reasonable to
                        assume, that they, by their conduct, were the great causes of that distress.
                        (Hear.) Time was, when the poorest class of the people brought home to their
                        families, the honest and productive earnings of their daily labour; when
                        that which had been acquired by toil was shared with joy; and when the
                        industrious labourer might view with pride the comforts which rewarded his
                        daily exertions. Those comforts, that subsistence, however, were now to be
                        obtained by other means—means at which their indigent but manly ancestors
                        would have blushed. It was impossible not to revert, in the contemplation of
                        the general distress which pervaded so large and invaluable a portion of
                        society, to those beautiful lines which Goldsmith, in his boundless
                        acquaintance with the feelings of the human heart, had so felicitously
                        introduced in the “Deserted Village.” He would beg their lordships
                        permission to quote the passage; premising, that the mournful necessity
                        under which so many of his countrymen had lately found themselves compelled
                        to leave the country of their birth was exactly imaged in them:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Ah, no! to distant climes, a dreary scene,</l>
                        <l>Where half the convex world intrudes between,</l>
                        <l>Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,</l>
                        <l>Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.</l>
                        <l>——————</l>
                        <l>Far different there from all that charm’d before,</l>
                        <l>The various terrors of that horrid shore.</l>
                        <l>Far different these from ev’ry former scene,</l>
                        <l>The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,</l>
                        <l>The breezy covert of the warbling grove ——</l>
                        <l>Good heaven! What sorrows gloomed that parting day,</l>
                        <l>That call’d them from their native walks away;</l>
                        <l>When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,</l>
                        <l>Hung round the bowers, and fondly look’d their last.</l>
                        <l>And took a long farewell, and wish’d in vain,</l>
                        <l>For seats like these beyond the western main.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>All this he feared, was but the poetical anticipation of a scene which would
                        but too soon be realized. He could not forbear adding two lines, which
                        contained a precept, the truth of which was too unfortunately felt at this
                        moment, to make it necessary for him to enlarge upon it:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>That trade’s proud empire hastes to swift decay,</l>
                        <l>As ocean sweeps the laboured mole away.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>When they heard of 300 wretched beings being “massed” together, as it was
                        emphatically termed, in transports destined to distant and almost unknown
                        shores; upon the uncertain chance of finding there the subsistence which
                        they could not procure at home; and packed and “massed” like so many bales
                        of indigo or tobacco, what were they to think of the government under which
                        their misery had accumulated to such an height? Could they acquit ministers
                        of all blame? Good God! <hi rend="underline">they would not surely have the
                            audacity to say, that it was brought by Providence</hi>! (Hear.) No; <hi
                            rend="underline">it was brought on by the measures pursued by noble
                            lords opposite</hi>; the human means were to be found in their conduct.
                        The sole escape for the vessel of the state, <hi rend="underline">the only
                            chance of her preservation</hi> among the rocks and perils which
                        encompassed her, was in that <hi rend="underline">moderate reform</hi>,
                        which would <hi rend="underline">advance</hi> and <hi rend="underline"
                            >increase the purity</hi>, without <hi rend="underline">endangering the
                            health and vigour of the constitution</hi>. Before he sat down, he would
                        observe that the magistracy were now vested with powers, so increased, that
                        he might say they reached to the furthest verge of the island; but <hi
                            rend="underline">he sincerely thanked God, that there still remained to
                            Englishmen</hi>, even when the Crown itself had enlarged its
                        prerogative, <hi rend="underline">one means, and one only</hi>, of legally
                        resisting to a certain degree, the power of the Crown; by those means, he
                        meant, not adverse force; not the sword, nor the dagger; but one small
                        thing, (in his idea, however, a most powerful one)—the influence of public
                        opinion. It was that which, when arrested, compressed, and confined, would
                        in its expansion <hi rend="underline">carry all before it</hi>; it would
                        break opposing bayonets, and bolts, and bars to atoms; and still more
                        powerful gold would vainly endeavour to restrain it. Let them heap Pelion
                        upon Ossa, it would dash them in its struggles to fragments. If it held that
                        national freedom was the right of a people, they would become nationally
                        free; if it deemed that moderate reform was necessary, moderate reform would
                        prevail; if it considered that abuses should be rectified, abuses would
                        cease. All history proclaimed the triumph of public opinion. What, he would
                        ask, put down the tyranny of James II? A single shout, the echo of the
                        public opinion, which resounded from Westminster-hall at the acquittal of
                        the 7 Bishops. What accomplished the French revolution? <hi rend="underline"
                            >Not, surely, the small handful of men who stormed the Bastille; but the
                            sentence which public opinion had pronounced upon the tyranny</hi> of
                        the government, the vices of the state, and <hi rend="underline">the
                            condition of the nobility</hi>. What brought back Napoleon Bonaparte
                        from Elba? Was it any expedition, any armament? No, but some opinion; and
                        what was that? That after his restoration, the King had sacrified his
                        sincerity! and, indeed, they had reason enough to think so. Nobody could
                        respect more than he did the King of France; but at that time he had been
                        guided by bad advisers. The King of France had since acted in such a manner
                        as all in his situation should do; and that circumstance alone had kept him
                        on his throne: if ever he departed from those principles, the loss of the
                        affections of his people must prove his overthrow. For himself, he (Earl
                        Grosvenor) wished all nations to be free, whatever the consequence might be.
                        If the liberty of France straitened our own means somewhat, or even
                        detracted something from the glory of Great Britain, he should still be most
                        happy for the event. The noble lord <hi rend="underline">had been
                            boasting</hi> that night of the course pursued by himself and his
                        colleagues; <hi rend="underline">of retrenchment of expenditure</hi>, of the
                        abolition of sinecures. But <hi rend="underline">it was to public opinion
                            that any alteration of the system was owing</hi>. (Hear, hear.) As long
                        as they could, they had resisted it: among its opponents was the noble and
                        learned lord (whom he did not blame for the interest he took in the
                        question,) and the noble lord opposite. The abolition of sinecures, however,
                        they coupled with pensions to an immoderate amount—a way of proceeding which
                        considerably detracted from the merits of their retrenchment on the other
                        side; for instead of effecting a saving of £200,000, their pensions reduced
                        the amount to between £20,000 and £40,000. What produced an alteration in
                        the traverse bill? Certainly, it was not due to the noble lords, but to
                        public opinion. In the other house, not all the great eloquence of the noble
                        lord who had brought forward the Grampound business; not all the talents
                        which had distinguished his conduct in that instance (and great, he
                        understood, they were); not all the abuses in elections which himself and
                        his hon. friends had so forcibly described; would ever have caused any thing
                        like a successful termination to his labours, but for <hi rend="underline"
                            >the influence of public opinion</hi>, which his Majesty’s ministers
                        must have felt. <hi rend="underline">Even to those who advocated annual
                            parliaments and universal suffrage</hi>, he (Lord Grosvenor) <hi
                            rend="underline">would say, rest on your oars; if you are right, by this
                            you must succeed; if you are wrong, in this you will fail</hi>; and you
                            <hi rend="underline">must then be satisfied with defeat</hi>. As to the
                        subject of the distress which prevailed throughout the country, he knew well
                        that a noble lord, in his eye, would turn round, and say, ‘What we do for
                        them, we do as a favour: we cannot help their distress; but we will extend
                        to them our protection from plunder and outrage.’ Protection! Yes; such
                        protection as Pizarro extended to the Peruvians; and <hi rend="underline">as
                            for plunder, he was not quite sure that they were not in almost as much
                            danger in that respect from other quarters, as from the radicals</hi>.
                        There was not much prospect of increasing the property of those who had
                        already complained of burdens, by the additional expense of 10,000
                        additional men; and it was pretty clear that, so far from relieving those
                        who suffered most, this expense was another tax upon those who had not yet
                        experienced the same extent of distress. The noble earl concluded by
                        apologizing to the house for the length at which he had detained them.”

                        COMMITTED AT MANCHESTER</p>
                    <p>A requisition having been presented to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of
                        York, signed by above 400 respectable inhabitants of that town and
                        neighbourhood, desiring him to call a public meeting, to take into
                        consideration the late unfortunate events at Manchester, his Lordship
                        appointed this day (Monday) for that purpose; and erected a hustings in the
                        Guildhall, in order to accommodate the different gentlemen who were likely
                        to attend as orators on the occasion.</p>
                    <p>About 10 in the morning, 4000 or 5,000 people paraded the streets of the
                        city, with banners and music, and in what is called at Manchester martial
                        array, for they marched in a regular procession of six abreast. A man
                        preceded them with a large black board on a pole, on each side of which was
                        inscribed, in white letters, “Order,” whilst the whole of it was decorated
                        with black crepe. The band of music came next, making a horrible discord of
                        unmusical sounds; after which was borne a very large flag, inscribed “Magna
                        Carta,” “Trial by Jury,” “Bill of Rights,” and “Liberty of the Press”; then
                        a yellow flag, with the inscription “To the immortal memory of the Reformers
                        killed at Manchester on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of August.” The union
                        flag succeeded, inscribed “England, Scotland, and Ireland,” similar to that
                        exhibited by the orator at Smithfield. The whole were decorated with emblems
                        of mourning. In Coney-street, the band played “The Dead March in Saul,”
                        during which the great concourse of people took their hats off their heads,
                        and by remaining uncovered gave to the spectacle a very solemn and imposing
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>About half-past 11 o’clock, the Committee, accompanied by the Hon. L. Dundas,
                        W. Bryan Cooke, Esq. S.W. Nicoll, Esq. and several other gentlemen of
                        respectability, proceeded from Etridge’s Hotel to the Mansion House. On
                        arriving there they were loudly greeted by the populace.</p>
                    <p>Precisely at 12 o’clock the Right Honourable Lord Mayor opened the business
                        by stating, that in consequence of having received a requisition most
                        respectably and most numerously signed, he had convened the present Meeting,
                        and requested the Town Clerk (R. Townend, Esq.) to read the requisition.
                        This was accordingly done; after which the Lord Mayor said, that from the
                        confidence which he had that they all concur in maintaining good order, and
                        would conduct themselves with the utmost propriety, he had not placed a
                        single constable in attendance, nor sworn in an additional special
                        constable. He had always seen the greatest order prevalent in the city, and
                        until he saw something otherwise, nothing of that sort should ever be done.
                        Having thus briefly opened the Meeting, he intimated to it the necessity of
                        appointing a chairman. An universal cry of “The Lord Mayor in the chair”
                        immediately pervaded the whole of the Hall, and his Lordship took the chair
                        amid the enthusiastic greetings of the assembled multitude. He observed,
                        that at so numerous a Meeting as that which he saw before him there might be
                        different opinions on the subject, he therefore hoped that they might give
                        every gentleman who wanted to address them an attentive hearing, and that
                        they would confine themselves to the subject of the requisition.</p>
                    <p>S.W. NICOLL, Esq. (One of the Counsel to the City of York, and also Recorder
                        of Doncaster) then rose. He said, that in bringing forward the resolutions
                        of that day, it was not his intention to address them as friends of
                        Parliamentary Reform, or as its enemies, but as Englishmen, who possessed a
                        free constitution, and who were entitled to the benefit of the laws, made
                        equally for the benefit of all (hear!). In reprobating the breach made on
                        those laws and that constitution by the late transactions at Manchester, all
                        parties must join, since it was only by their conjunction that redress could
                        be obtained (hear!). He trusted, therefore, that they would, through the
                        proceedings of the day, carefully avoid whatever might be a ground of
                        division either there or elsewhere: the Meeting at which they were then
                        assembled, it was not unlikely, might serve as an example to numerous others
                        in the country; but it could only do so by avoiding subjects of offence, and
                        by strictly confining itself to that point in which all of them could
                        coincide (cheers). The resolutions which he intended to offer to their
                        notice were grounded on a few facts and principles which appeared to him to
                        be incontrovertible. The first was, that it was the constitutional right of
                        the people of England publicly to discuss State grievances, and thereon to
                        address, petition, or remonstrate, as they might deem expedient. This was
                        not the right of the high and opulent alone; it was the right of all; it was
                        the right not of 70 or 700 only, but of 70,000, or of any numbers, who
                        conceived themselves aggrieved; it was a right not to be exercised as suited
                        the mere pleasure of Ministers, or Magistrates, or military (if it were so,
                        they might assemble indeed to congratulate or approve, but never could
                        assemble to petition, or remonstrate); but it was a right to be exercised at
                        the pleasure of the people themselves, unconfined and unrestrained, so long
                        as disorder or excess was not committed by them. In the next place, he held
                        that the meeting of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of August was in strict
                        pursuance of the above right—it was for a lawful purpose. This was clear
                        from the nature of the notice. The people assembled peaceably, and nothing
                        tending to disorder had occurred, or was likely to have occurred, when the
                        violent irruption of the volunteer cavalry took place. Much had been said,
                        and pretences had been held out of arms and military array. What was this
                        military array? The people walked in ranks, as is usual on almost every
                        occasion of solemnity. Freemasons walked in ranks (hear!); friendly
                        societies walked in ranks (hear!); the Corporation of their city walked in
                        ranks. Was there any thing alarming or destructive of peace in such
                        processions? No; it was simply for the sake of more solemn effect. The story
                        of arms was equally absurd: the people came from the country, and, like
                        other countrymen, carried each his stick. That they were not armed, even to
                        the point of self-defence, was quite clear. Had they been armed, dreadful
                        indeed might have been the result, and not hundreds but thousands must have
                        felt the miseries of that day. He also observed, that the circumstances
                        attending the Meeting precluded every surmise of intended tumult, or
                        probable disorder. <hi rend="underline">What was its purpose?—to express an
                            adherence to the principles of Reform with that effect which combined
                            numbers might give</hi>. Similar Meetings, comprising similar numbers,
                        had been held in various parts of the country; neither tumult nor riot
                        appeared on any occasion; the object was uniformly the same expression of
                        opinion. What had the people of Manchester—what could they have, in view
                        beyond this? Meetings of 10,000 or 20,000 men do not usually keep secrets:
                        they profess all they mean, and that usually with a momentary vehemence,
                        which rather exceeds than falls short of their real sentiments. In 1792 and
                        the following years, the public placards, meetings, speeches, etc. went far
                        beyond what was now seen. Every portion of our established authorities was
                        then in turn attacked. If the views of the present day were the same with
                        those of that day, their conduct and expressions would also be the same. But
                        that they were not the same, even those who did, against all probability,
                        believe in the existence of designs hostile to the Government, were
                        reluctantly obliged to confess: <hi rend="underline">not a single
                            transaction at any one public Meeting had shown the people to be
                            proceeding in any such wicked or pernicious designs; they debated and
                            resolved; they attempted nothing further</hi>: indeed, they were wholly
                        unprepared for any further attempt. On these principles and these facts the
                        inference was clear that <hi rend="underline">the interruption of the
                            Meeting</hi> of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        <hi rend="underline">was illegal, unconstitutional, and inhuman</hi>
                        (cheers). Indeed, he could not for a moment doubt on the particulars of this
                        business of blood, which was too deeply infixed in the minds and memories of
                        all who heard him ever to be obliterated from them (loud cheerings). He was
                        not at all surprised at their cheering, because no man could regard the
                        transactions of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> without horror: this
                        circumstance, however, rendered the calm deliberate approbation of his
                        Majesty’s Ministers a business of still deeper dye, and a more extended
                        evil. <hi rend="underline">It showed the principle on which this kingdom was
                            meant in future to be governed</hi>—he meant by military violence; and,
                        in that point of view, the mischief of the approbation <hi rend="underline"
                            >a thousand fold exceeded the mischief of the fact itself</hi>. If that
                        lamentable business had stood alone, it might in time have passed away and
                        been forgotten: but it was now no single insulated fact; it was a precedent
                        by which future Meetings were to be dispersed, and liberty in future
                        abridged (cheers). The inference he drew from the conduct of his Majesty’s
                        Ministers, on this occasion, and on every other occasion connected with the
                        Meetings of the people, was, that they were <hi rend="underline">unworthy of
                            the confidence of the Prince Regent and of the nation</hi> (long and
                        loud cheering). He did not speak of their <hi rend="underline">general
                            conduct</hi> or ordinary principles of Government; he confined himself
                        wholly to their <hi rend="underline">treatment of that body of men
                            denominated the Reformers</hi>. It was asserted by many, that the
                        principles of Reform were held only by certain trading districts, and by
                        them merely when suffering from the state of trade: in fact, that there was
                        no such principle; that it was a pretext, a mere mode of exhibiting
                        dissatisfaction at the present state of things. If this were so, which he
                        believed it was not, when large bodies of men were in a state of suffering
                        and deprivation, when, in consequence of the pressure of their feelings,
                        they became dissatisfied and vehement, what was the course of a wise and
                        humane Government towards such a body of its subjects? To execute against
                        them all the existing laws in full severity? To enact new laws for their
                        punishment? To persecute and injure them beyond all law? <hi
                            rend="underline">Clearly not</hi> (cheers). It was the duty of the
                        Government to take the earliest and most vigorous measures for restoring the
                        comforts of those suffering classes (hear, hear!). He did, however, most
                        firmly believe the principle of <hi rend="underline">Parliamentary Reform to
                            be spread among the people</hi> far beyond those districts—that it
                        existed wholly independent of the depression of trade—that it was daily
                        extending, and that it <hi rend="underline">was deeply rooted in the
                            people’s heart</hi>. The real state of the public’s mind on the question
                        of Reform was, perhaps, <hi rend="underline">the most important one that was
                            ever connected with the Government of this kingdom</hi>: he had long
                        felt it to be so: he had long taken every means in his power to ascertain
                        how the fact actually stood: the result was a firm persuasion that this
                        principle was neither local nor temporary—<hi rend="underline">that no
                            measures, that no ministers could extinguish it</hi>—and <hi
                            rend="underline">that a continuation of that mode of opposing it which
                            the Ministers had for some years adopted would deluge the nation in
                            blood</hi>, and overturn every existing establishment (loud cheers). A
                        whole people was not to be persecuted, insulted, over-awed (No, no! it
                        cannot): a nation could neither be arrested, nor imprisoned, nor tried, nor
                        executed (cheers). Two years and a half ago, meetings similar to these now
                        held took place in several districts; the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended;
                        several hundred persons were imprisoned; a momentary check of public
                        declarations followed, but was the principle checked? By no means; it was
                        invigorated (for persecution always invigorated what it attacked), and thus
                        was enabled to break out again with a firmness and unanimity far exceeding
                        that which had been exhibited in 1817. The Habeas Corpus Act was now most
                        wisely left untouched; the Parliament separated; and next to some act of
                        positive concession to the Reformers, this was clearly the wisest mode to
                        pursue; unfortunately, <hi rend="underline">it was too wise to be
                            continued</hi>. The scenes of blood witnessed at Manchester followed
                        shortly after, <hi rend="underline">and redoubled the zeal and ardour of the
                            Reformers</hi>. At the same time that their numbers were increased, and
                        their injuries commiserated, the Government voluntarily held itself forth as
                        the mark of public hatred and execration (loud and long cheers).—The
                        inference was decisive: it was not in the hands that thus wielded them that
                        the powers of Government ought to remain in times so perilous (cheers). It
                        might be asked, if Parliamentary Reform was the sole object of the
                        Reformers, where was the danger of the country? He would tell them: the
                        danger was this—tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of disappointed
                        and irritated citizens would meet in every part of the kingdom; a strict
                        union would be formed amongst them, a union in object and in plan; their
                        numbers would be fully ascertained, and their confidence in consequence
                        increased. <hi rend="underline">Firmly as he believed the Reformers to be
                            now unconnected with hostile views to the Government, could it be hoped
                            that, if treated as they now were treated, they would long continue
                            so?</hi> Could any man acquainted with history believe <hi
                            rend="underline">that millions would submit to insult, denial, and
                            persecution?</hi> They were not now inclined—they would hereafter be
                        driven to courses inconsistent with the established institutions: <hi
                            rend="underline">it was not in human nature to be persecuted, and not,
                            with or without law, to rise against their persecutors</hi> (cheers)!
                        How was this to be avoided? By placing the Government in other hands, in the
                        hands of Ministers who would listen to the people, hear their complaints,
                        attend to their wishes, conciliate their feelings, and redress their
                        grievances.—This was not the proper place for suggesting any particular plan
                        of proceeding: what he insisted on was a temper, a disposition on the part
                        of those in power, wholly dissonant from that which we have for years known,
                        which was wholly dissonant from that mild and lenient disposition, which at
                        no distant period was able to sooth the irritated state of the country, and
                        secure its future tranquillity. The Learned Gentleman, in conclusion,
                        repeated, that he did not address them as either Whigs or Tories, friends or
                        enemies to Reform, but as men who would join in the Resolutions of that day
                        from a firm conviction that they were the sure and only source of the future
                        tranquillity of the country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NICOLL then read the following Resolutions, which he told the Meeting
                        would afterwards be put one by one:—</p>
                    <p>“Resolved, 1. That it is the constitutional right of the people of this
                        kingdom publicly to consult on all matters of state, and to express their
                        sentiments in the form of Resolutions, Petitions, or Remonstrances, as
                        circumstances may seem to them to require.</p>
                    <p>“2. That the Meeting held at Manchester on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        August last, was in correspondence with the above constitutional right of
                        the people; and that neither in the notice which preceded that Meeting, nor
                        in the conduct of the people in approaching it, nor in their demeanour when
                        actually assembled, was any unconstitutional act committed, or any act
                        amounting to a breach of the peace, or to a just source of alarm to any of
                        his Majesty’s subjects.</p>
                    <p>“3. That the conduct of the persons who took the lead in the business of the
                        Meeting on the above occasion, considering them independent of any political
                        party question, as British subjects, firmly asserting their rights, is
                        highly praiseworthy, and merits the approbation of every friend to freedom
                        and his country; and that the thanks of this Meeting are hereby given to
                        them for the forbearance they exhibited, and their unwillingness to disturb
                        the public peace.</p>
                    <p>“4. That the interruption of the proceedings of the above Meeting by the
                        Yeomanry Cavalry, under the direction of the Magistrates, was illegal and
                        unconstitutional, and unworthy of the Citizens of a free country, and of a
                        magistracy, by its office the protectors of the people’s rights.</p>
                    <p>“5. That the subsequent approbation of the proceedings of the above day,
                        issued in the name of the Prince Regent, but on the responsibility of his
                        Majesty’s Ministers, has a lamentable tendency to create disunion in this
                        kingdom; to fix in the minds of the people an apprehension that their safety
                        is not duly regarded by the high authorities of the realm, and that their
                        rights are objects of jealousy, suspicion and attack.</p>
                    <p>“6. That the Ministers, whose views and principles have led them thus to
                        misuse his Royal Highness’s name, are wholly unworthy of his confidence, and
                        of the confidence of the nation; and that it is our determination humbly to
                        address his Royal Highness to remove them from his counsels and his
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>“7. That a subscription be immediately entered into for the purpose of
                        affording relief to the sufferers under the late unlawful attack; and for
                        the purpose of inflicting that justice on the authors and perpetrators
                        thereof which the laws of our country are ready to afford.</p>
                    <p>“8. That a Committee, Treasurer and Secretary to the subscription, be
                        appointed; and that a Committee of eight gentlemen be appointed to carry the
                        same into effect.</p>
                    <p>“9. That the Address now read is adopted as the act of this Meeting, and
                        shall be immediately transmitted to his Royal Highness.”</p>
                    <p>(Here an Address, founded on the foregoing Resolutions, was read to the
                        Meeting.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alderman DUNSLAY rose to second the Resolutions. After commenting on the
                        politeness with which the Lord Mayor had received their Requisition, and on
                        the readiness with which he had attended to it, he proceeded to say, that he
                        had little doubt but peace and order would be observed, although, as the
                        Meeting had heard, there were no special constables in attendance, nor had
                        he or any of his brother Magistrates put the Riot Act into their pockets
                        (applause). The late Meeting at Manchester was strictly constitutional, and
                        the conduct of the people assembled at it highly decorous; if it had been
                        improper, it was the duty of the Magistrates to have gone among the people,
                        and ordered them to be peaceable; if after this they still acted wrongfully,
                        it was then the duty of the Magistrates to read the Riot Act, and to give
                        the multitude an hour to disperse in. But was this, or aught like this done?
                        No; instead of it, the dreadful work of havoc was begun; the cavalry—not the
                        soldiery, for they would have disdained to act thus—the Yeomanry Cavalry, a
                        new name unknown to our Constitution, was let loose upon a peaceable,
                        unoffending and unarmed multitude, many of whom they put to the sword,
                        regardless both of age and sex (cheers). Immediately after this dreadful
                        carnage, the Magistrates of Manchester sent two delegates to London, who
                        told their own tale, and received the thanks of his Majesty’s Ministers, in
                        the name of the Prince Regent. The people of England had been charged with
                        prejudging the Magistrates of Manchester, by thus meeting together; but this
                        could not be a just ground of accusation, after the vote of thanks which had
                        been passed on them for their conduct. The worthy Alderman then contrasted
                        the vote of thanks presented to the Magistrates with the declaration of
                        certain inhabitants of Manchester against their barbarity, which has long
                        since appeared in all the public journals, and concluded by saying, that all
                        he asked was, that their conduct should be submitted to inquiry, and that
                        they should have a fair trial by a jury of their countrymen. If they were
                        found guilty, they ought to suffer the punishment which the law awards to
                        crimes like theirs; but if they were innocent, their deeds ought to be
                        rewarded in the temple of fame, and they themselves not pointed out as
                        objects of hatred to the great mass of their fellow-citizens (applause).</p>
                    <p>The Hon. L. DUNDAS, M.P. for York, then came forward, and was loudly cheered
                        by the Meeting. After the very excellent speech of his Learned Friend, who
                        had brought forward these Resolutions, and also that of the worthy Alderman
                        who succeeded him, it was totally unnecessary for him to say much. The
                        present was a question of a very novel and extraordinary nature; it was
                        this—is there a constitution or is there not? (cheers). If the people had
                        not a right to meet, the Bill of Rights was nothing more than a dead letter;
                        if the right of assembling was to be limited at the will of the magistracy,
                        the Bill of Rights was nothing; for then any timid person, by making a timid
                        affidavit before a timid Magistrate, might have the most legal meeting
                        immediately dispersed; and yet it was upon this very ground that an attempt
                        was made to justify the Magistrates of Manchester (hear!). He maintained,
                        that the people had a right to meet as they did, if they chose. To have a
                        little music to give weight to their Meeting could not be productive of any
                        danger to the community; nor yet could it be injurious to it that the
                        countrymen should walk together in ranks, or, as it was now termed, martial
                        array; for what harm could possibly result from the playing of a fife or the
                        beating of a drum? He would fairly own, that if there were any danger from
                        martial array, it was from the martial array of those who were sent in to
                        attack the people (cheers). Though he fully agreed with the general spirit
                        of the Resolutions, he could not help observing, that he was rather in
                        favour of an Address demanding inquiry, than of a Declaration expressing
                        their opinions on the late unfortunate circumstances. He objected to the
                        latter plan, because he did not wish the Meeting to imitate his Majesty’s
                        Ministers in any thing. He did not wish to pre-judge the question, as they
                        had first done themselves, and as they had afterwards forced their Royal
                        Master to do; for that he too had pre-judged was evident from a comparison
                        of dates. The melancholy events took place on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
                        and the Prince Regent’s thanks were dated the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
                        (hear, hear!). He said thus much to them, his constituents, because he was
                        now, and had been from his earliest youth upwards, a friend to the liberty
                        of the people; he trusted that he should be so to the day of his death, and
                        that, dying, he might bequeath that sentiment to his son (loud applause). It
                        was said that this was a party question; this he positively denied: it was a
                        question between the lovers of the constitution and its enemies; and if it
                        ever became a party question, it would be owing to the Government leaguing
                        itself openly with the Magistrates. After pledging himself to support an
                        inquiry into this dark business, both in the House and out of it, the
                        Honourable and Worthy Member retired from the front of the Hustings, amid a
                        volley of applause.</p>
                    <p>Colonel COOKE, of Wheatley, as he could not rest satisfied with himself, if
                        he gave merely a silent vote upon so extraordinary, so novel, and so
                        important an occasion as the present, begged the indulgence of the Meeting
                        for a few moments, to express his sentiments very briefly. The present
                        discussion had arisen from a most violent attack having been made upon the
                        constitution, and from the liberty of the subject having been invaded in the
                        most extraordinary and alarming manner. In the preservation of those
                        liberties and that constitution every individual was and must be interested,
                        without reference to any party or any set of men whatsoever; and it was,
                        therefore, their bounden duty to call for a full inquiry, and to prevent
                        such an alarming attack upon the rights and privileges of Englishmen either
                        from passing unnoticed, or from being drawn into a precedent (loud
                        cheering). From all the intelligence that had hitherto reached the public,
                        three facts appear to be established—namely, that the meeting was legally
                        convened, peaceably conducted, and violently dispersed. These three facts
                        being established, and doubts still existing, from the suppression of
                        circumstances which might and ought to have been communicated to the public
                        by those who were parties to them, and who knew accurately all that had
                        passed, surely it was their duty to insist upon a thorough investigation of
                        all that had preceded and passed upon that melancholy occasion, especially
                        after his Royal Highness the Prince Regent had been graciously pleased to
                        inform the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London, that with respect to the
                        Meeting at Manchester, they had not been correctly informed (loud cheering).
                        The gallant Colonel then proceeded to observe, that Sir William Blackstone,
                        who had never been charged with subjecting the prerogative of the Crown to
                        popular clamour, had, in his Commentary on the Laws of England, recognized
                        the Statute of William and Mary, which declared, “that the subject had a
                        right to petition, and that all commitments and prosecutions for such
                        petitioning were illegal.” Still, in saying this, he wished to be distinctly
                        understood; he did not by these observations endeavour to prejudice the real
                        conduct of the Magistrates, but to place them only on the same footing on
                        which every Englishman ought to be placed who had been accessory in
                        producing such fatal results as they all knew had occurred at Manchester,
                        and to request that they might answer for and explain such conduct (hear,
                        hear!). He wished to God that others had been equally cautious in not
                        prejudging a case so important, and in not holding out the approbation of
                        the Executive Power, before it could be known that such conduct had deserved
                        it (cheers). Though he could not give more than a qualified assent to all
                        the Resolutions, yet he most cordially concurred in the general objects of
                        the Meeting, and heartily joined them in resolving to preserve the most
                        valuable of all rights an Englishman can enjoy—of meeting to consider the
                        real state of the country, and to suggest any legal means of correcting any
                        evils which, upon due inquiry, may be discovered (hear!). He was astonished
                        by the moderation and temperance with which their proceedings had been
                        conducted. Probably, the discussion of that day might give a tone to other
                        country Meetings (hear!); and he trusted might induce men of honesty, who
                        were anxious to remedy defects, but to preserve every thing that was
                        valuable, to rally round and uphold the Constitution; “for all of us,” to
                        quote again the words of Sir W. Blackstone, “have it in our choice to do
                        every thing that a good man would desire to do, and are restrained from
                        nothing but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or our
                        fellow-citizens; and in so doing we should best perform our duty to our
                        country” (hear, hear!). The gallant Colonel, who at the last election was
                        the unsuccessful candidate for the representation of York, then retired amid
                        the loud and enthusiastic shouts of the surrounding multitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WALKER commenced by observing that as there was some difference of
                        opinion entertained by the Honourable Member for the City of York and the
                        last speaker, Colonel Cooke, with respect to the propriety of wording the
                        Resolutions, he would endeavour to prove that they were well founded, not
                        only on reason but truth; and, with his Lordship’s permission, he would take
                        the opportunity of addressing his fellow-countrymen on this mournful and
                        momentous occasion. The deeds of horror which had been perpetrated at
                        Manchester were of so dire a hue, and of a nature so truly appalling, that
                        they created a degree of emotion in the feeling mind, too intense to be
                        easily tolerated (hear, hear!). In all ages, and in all time, there have
                        been, and still are, men whose principles are subservient to their
                        self-interest; but above all, such ignorant and corrupt minions of a proud
                        and haughty faction, the Manchester Magistrates, stood proudly pre-eminent
                        (hear!). The page of history that records their exploits is written with the
                        blood of their country-men, and will ever stand a lasting and a blushing
                        monument of an unconstitutional and tyrannical encroachment on the
                        privileges of Englishmen (loud cheers of considerable duration). Well did an
                        enlightened Patriot observe, when speaking of the atrocities which these
                        weak, imbecile, and despotic wretches had perpetrated, that the plan on
                        which they had acted was a plan which none but fiends could have devised,
                        and none but devils have executed (cheers). They did indeed wear the form of
                        man, but it was quite evident that</p>
                    <p>Some devil had thrust sweet nature’s hand aside, Ere she had poured her balm
                        within their breasts, To warm their gross and earthy mould of flesh With
                        pity.</p>
                    <p>They wore also the garb of soldiers, but to dignify them with that
                        appellation would be a libel on the character; and therefore to point them
                        out to the scorn of future ages, they should henceforward be dignified with
                        an epithet synonimous to that of coward—they should be called Yeomanry
                        Cavalry-men, and should be celebrated for having the courage of lifting
                        their armed hand against the helpless loveliness of women, and the
                        unoffending innocence of harmless childhood (cheers). He then proceeded to
                        take a view of the conduct of the Magistrates of Manchester, whom he
                        denominated the instigators and authors of all those scenes of blood and
                        horror. In doing this, he desired to be properly understood. There was not
                        an individual in the land that entertained a more sincere and ardent
                        attachment to the law and Constitution of his country than he did, or that
                        more respected the high and dignified office of a Magistrate. How, indeed,
                        could he possibly entertain an opinion to the contrary, when he reflected on
                        the conduct of the worthy Gentlemen who compose the Bench of Magistrates in
                        his native City? Their conduct was always regulated by the principles of
                        justice, and their hearts were always guided by the dictates of humanity
                        (loud cheers). Yet when he found a Magistrate acting in direct contradiction
                        to the laws, he looked upon him as one of the worst enemies to the
                        Constitution. Looking upon the conduct of the Manchester Magistrates in this
                        light, he could not held [<emph>sic</emph> help] denouncing it as flagitious
                        and unconstitutional—flagitious, owing to the scenes of blood to which it
                        gave rise; unconstitutional, as it prevented the people from exercising the
                        sacred right of petition (cheers). He proceeded to comment on the subject
                        for a considerable time, and concluded his remarks on it by saying, that in
                        the face of the law, reason, justice, and humanity, these contemptible
                        puppets of despotism had declared the Meeting illegal, and with the most
                        fiend-like malignity let loose their infernal band of homicides to wallow in
                        the blood of their countrymen.—He then called the attention of the Meeting
                        to another class of offenders, of a far more dangerous description than
                        either the valiant calico heroes or the sapient bench of wiseacres or
                        wizards at Manchester: for the abuses of power in the one, he said, was
                        local; in the other, the evil was universal. It was hardly necessary for him
                        to say that he meant his Majesty’s Ministers, those who were called the
                        advisers and counsellors of the Prince Regent. He argued for some time that
                        it was absolutely necessary for the people to petition his Royal Highness to
                        dismiss them from his councils, if they wished to protect those rights and
                        those liberties which their fathers had bequeathed to them—(cheers); and
                        concluded a speech of considerable length, by declaring his cordial
                        concurrence with the Resolutions which had been submitted to them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. HARGROVE (the Editor of the York Herald), being then loudly called for by
                        the multitude, came forward to address them. He said, that though he had
                        already declared to the public his abhorrence of the proceedings of the

                        detestation of the hypocrisy of the Magistrates prior to the Meeting, and of
                        their horrid violation of both law and justice at that time; he was again
                        ready to declare to them: the abhorrence with which he viewed the cowardice
                        of the Yeomanry, in attacking the defenceless female and helpless infant,
                        and the savage barbarity which they afterwards exhibited in the cold-blooded
                        murders which they perpetrated. For the country, therefore, to be silent
                        after such atrocities, would be highly criminal, and would constitute a
                        direct invitation. He also concluded his speech by expressing his agreement
                        to the Resolutions proposed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Flower, Mr. Gill, and Mr. Walls, afterwards followed on the same side;
                        but as there was nothing either new or pointed in the arguments which they
                        advanced, we decline inserting them in our columns.</p>
                    <p>The LORD MAYOR then put the Resolutions above stated to the Meeting, and
                        declared them carried without a dissentient voice.</p>
                    <p>Another Resolution was then moved, seconded, and carried, that it is the
                        desire of this Meeting that the Committee already appointed do adopt such
                        measures as are requisite to carry the preceding Resolutions into
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>It was moved by Mr. NICOLL, and seconded by the Hon. L. DUNDAS, that the
                        Thanks of the Meeting be given to the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, for his
                        ready attention to the rights of the people by calling this Meeting, and for
                        his most independent and exemplary opinion in the Chair.</p>
                    <p>After it had been carried, the Lord Mayor returned thanks in a short
                        speech.</p>
                    <p>The multitude then dispersed without the least tumult, and thus fully
                        justified the confidence which the Lord Mayor had placed in them.

                            came before the jury, no right of challenge, the second security of
                            Englishmen, gave the accused Athenian means of guarding against
                            partiality in his judges. The effect of partiality in some, it was
                            indeed proposed to obviate by multitude, such that the majority should
                            not be likely to concur in it: but the disadvantages of such a resource
                            perhaps exceeded its benefits. In no conference among themselves could
                            the informed and the wary, of so numerous a court, correct the
                            prejudices and misjudgement of the ignorant, careless, or impassioned,
                            or obviate the effects of misused eloquence; nor was it possible to make
                            so large a portion of the sovereign people responsible for the most
                            irregular or flagitious decision. Punishment could not take place, and
                            among the multitude shame was lost. Under this constitution of
                            judicature, the most victorious and deserving general, the ablest and
                            most upright magistrate, or the most inoffensive private citizen, might
                            be brought to trial for his life at the pleasure of the most profligate
                            of mankind. Even the allegation of a specific crime, a crime defined by
                            law, was unnecessary. Constructive treason, any imputed disaffection to
                            the sovereignty of the people, sufficed; and, as passion and prejudice,
                            or the powers of oratory, or solicitation and bribery, moved,

                        great lawyer. A common law is said to exist before it is made—before it ever

                        be worked against common law. The judicial character ought not to exist with
                        the legislative—where it does laws are made for particular cases, and in
                        accord with individual passions and interests. This Aristotle’s admirable
                        objection. <note><emph>The Principles of Moral and Political

                    <p>Romilly says (<emph>ut supra</emph>) after Paley, that when this common law
                        is brought out of <emph>posse</emph> into <emph>esse</emph>, it is done by a
                        “competition of opposite analogies.” <del>The meaning is, that</del> When a
                        new case occurs for decision, to which no former decision is tolerably
                        applicable, what is to be done, is the question. The lawyers look out for
                        the cases which are likest to it. Some of them say that one set of cases are
                        likest to it, another that another are likest. The judge determines
                        according to those which he thinks the likest. Is this a competition of
                        opposite analogies? If so, there must be resembling cases, which formerly
                        have been decided opposite ways; and the judge may therefore, do as he
                        pleases. <note>Romilly, “Bentham on Codification,” <emph>Edinburgh

                    <p>To decide a point is to make a law—an <emph>ex-post-facto</emph> law—a law,
                        which being feigned, not to be made, but only declared, has a retrospective
                        operation, and unsettles all settlements of property, not in conformity with
                        it, which may have been formerly made; attaches criminality to all acts
                        contrary to it which may have been formerly done; and “there is no security

                    <p>This mode of making law has this farther inconvenience, that it excludes all
                        regard to the principle of utility. The question is, not what is best—but
                        what is most like the laws which already exist. That is to say—not what is
                        most conformable to the spirit of an enlightened age—but what is most
                        conformable to the spirit of a barbarous one.</p>
                    <p>Besides all this, the judge is confined to the particular case before him—and

                        so also he ought to take notice of the Law, from nothing but the Statutes

                        and by Authority interpret it upon the place. The Lords of Parliament in
                        England were Judges, and most difficult Causes have been heard and
                        determined by them; yet few of them were <anchor xml:id="cpb233vb1"/>much
                        versed in the Study of the Laws, and fewer had made Profession of them: And
                        though they consulted with Lawyers, that were appointed to be present there
                        for that Purpose; yet they alone had the Authority of giving Sentence. In
                        like manner, in the ordinary Trials of Right, twelve Men of the Common
                        People are Judges, and give Sentence, not only of the Fact, but also of the
                        Right; and in a Question of Crime, not only determine whether done or not
                        done; but also whether it be Murder, Homicide, Felony, Assault, and the like
                        which are Determinations of Law: but because they are not supposed to know
                        the Law themselves there is one that hath Authority to inform them of it, in
                        the particular Case they are to Judge of. But yet if they Judge not

                        Causes and Motives, for which it was made. That it is, that shews us the
                        Meaning of the Legislator; and the meaning of the Legislator known, the Law
                        is more easily understood by few than many words. For all words are subject
                        to Ambiguity, and therefore Multiplication of Words in the Body of the Law
                        is Multiplication of Ambiguity: Besides, it seems to imply, by too much
                        Diligence, that whosoever can evade the Words, is without the Compass of the
                        Law. And this is a Cause of many unnecessary Processes. For when I consider
                        how short were the Laws of ancient Times; and how they grew by degrees still

                        their Circumscriptions; and that the Pleaders have got the Victory. It
                        belongeth therefore to the Office of a Legislator (such as in all
                        Commonwealths the supreme Representative, be it one Man, or an Assembly), to
                        make the Reason perspicuous, why the Law was made; and the Body of the

                        independent, by being made irremovable.—Two sorts of dependence—one by
                            <del>terror</del> punishment —another by reward.—The latter may be as
                        strong as the former. To the latter judges still exposed, and in a more
                        irremediable manner than before. Before, a king, by the murmurs of the
                        people, would have been compelled to remove a bad judge—at present he may
                        make him as bad as he pleases—and the murmurs of the people can have no such
                        effect.—In fact it was the dependence of reward not of punishment, that was
                        the natural dependence before—that now more complete—the dependence of
                        judges in fact more complete than it was before. If the King were really
                        dependent upon parliament and parliament upon the people, removability at
                        the will <anchor xml:id="cpb233vb3b"/>of the people—irremovability at the
                        will of the king, independence of the people.—Render the judges independent

                        vest them with arbitrary power—but arbitrary power in the hands of a judge I
                        hate still more than in those of a king.</p>
                    <p>Judges when displaced, come again to the bar, where their reputation was
                        their bread—being always liable to be made thus dependent on their
                        reputation, that is, the good opinion of the people, they were anxious not
                        to forfeit it. They are now exempt from such fears. They are dependent on
                        parliament—but parliament is dependent on the minister—if they please, then,
                        the minister, they have nothing to fear.</p>

                    <p>The following a summary of the rationale of Evidence.</p>
                    <p>All <del>rights</del> by which life is secured [or] is worth the securing
                        depends upon the enjoyment of rights.</p>
                    <p>The enjoyment of rights depends upon evidence.</p>
                    <p>What is desirable is, that of any fact important to be known, there should be
                        evidence—that it should be <del>produced</del> forthcoming—and that it
                        should not deceive.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the first, causing evidence to exist, though much may be done
                        by the legislator there is still more which cannot. What can be done is
                        considered under Preappointed.</p>
                    <p>With regard to causing evidence to be <del>produced</del> forthcoming, the
                        consideration of this belongs to the kind of Procedure.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <del>prevention of causing a</del> preventing of deception
                        from evidence, this is in reality the grand business of a work on
                        evidence.</p>
                    <p>The means of causing evidence to exist—the means of making evidence excite
                        none but correct belief—these are the objects of the present work. The
                        latter, as being the principal branch, is taken first by Mr. Bentham.</p>
                    <p>To know what are the means of making evidence excite none but correct belief,
                        it is previously necessary to know what is the first or lowest degree of
                        evidence, on which belief may with security be rested. The testimony of a
                        man of ordinary understanding, and probity, deposing to a fact of which he
                        was a percipient witness, and of which he had an adequate comprehension, Mr.
                        Bentham presents as the measure or <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap34rb2"/>standard
                        of that degree. Whatever is beneath that standard, is proportionally
                        untrustworthy—whatever is above it, is pre-eminently trustworthy.</p>
                    <p>To explain the foundation of the security which may be reposed in the
                        testimony of such a witness so deposing, it is necessary to enter profoundly
                        into the examination of the connection between human testimony, and the act
                        of mind we call belief. This is performed in the book called Theoretic
                        Grounds.</p>
                    <p>The testimony of a witness so deposing being the standard—not to be deceived
                        is to know when evidence falls below that standard—when it rises up to or
                        above it.</p>
                    <p>Of evidence, there are two grand sources—one is persons—the other things.
                        That from the first source may be called personal, the other real—or the one
                        testimonial, the other inferential.</p>
                    <p>What concerns the evidence derived from things is considered under the title
                        circumstantial evidence; and is a narrow subject compared with the other
                        branch, the <del>evidence of</del> testimony of persons. That is considered
                        under a variety of titles.</p>
                    <p>In general with regard to the evidence of which persons, i.e., testimony is
                        the source, there is little difficulty in the cases which rise above the
                        standard. These, in respect of persons, are the cases, in which the
                        intellectual or moral part of the <del>man’s</del> deponent’s frame [of
                        mind] are above the ordinary standard—or where more than <del>the number
                            of</del> one witness of the ordinary qualities depose to the same
                        fact.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty consists in distinguishing the cases which fall below the
                        standard—it is there only deception can have place. It is for the
                        distinguishing of these cases, and <del>supplying</del> for extracting the
                        truth, where it would otherwise be withheld, that almost all[?] <anchor
                            xml:id="cpb2scrap34r2va"/>practical arrangements, <del>are made</del> of
                        judication, respecting evidence, are made.</p>

                            either when the state of the</del> _<del>his</del>_ <del>man’s mind is
                            below the standard—or when the proper securities for ascertaining the
                            trustworthiness of his testimony |are wanting| have not been
                            applied</del>.</p>
                    <p>The question then is, what are the proper tests, for determining the
                        trustworthiness of testimony; what are the <del>operations</del> means that
                        may be made use of to render it truer and that to the greatest degree than
                        it would otherwise be liable to be.</p>
                    <p>Of the securities or tests Mr. Bentham treats in two books—the first with the
                        Title Securities—the next Extraction.</p>
                    <p>Besides the securities treated of in these books another has figured much in
                        practical systems, viz., Exclusion of certain species of evidence, deemed
                        untrustworthy. Of this Mr. Bentham treats at great length in a separate
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The Connection between evidence and belief being treated of in Theoretic
                        Grounds—the arrangements which may be taken for making evidence to exist

                        the Evidence derived from Persons and the Evidence derived from things
                        treated of in the Books, denominated Securities—Extraction, and
                        Circumstantial, the subject appears to be exhausted. <del>It still</del> As
                        however, <del>appeared to the author, that</del> of the different
                        modifications of evidence, that derived from persons and that derived from
                        things taken together, <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap34r2vb"/>these are some of
                        frequent occurrence, and often of necessary use, which are eminently
                        untrustworthy, it appeared to the author, that the peculiar cautions under
                        which these species of evidence ought to be received, required to be pointed
                        out as a distinct subject of regard, these species of evidence are
                        accordingly treated of, under the title Make-shift evidence.</p>
                    <p>These subjects, thus connected, the author has found it convenient for
                        discussion to arrange in the following manner.</p>

                        evidence.</note></p>

                        catastrophe.—A woman left a widow with a large family—and some little
                        property in houses to her children had occasion for parish relief—the parish
                        insisted upon the houses—the woman exasperated at the painful condition
                        declared she would rather burn the houses—the parish adhered to their
                        demand—the woman desperate, employed one of her children, to set fire to the

                    <p>A woman has, by the nature of the case, perfect and equal knowledge of two
                        facts.—To the one she is a good witness—to the other she is no witness at
                        all. A married woman, in the absence of her husband, proven with child. She
                        charges the paternity upon a particular man, and swears that she has had no
                        intercourse with her husband, within the natural period. Her evidence is
                        good to prove that she has had connection with the stranger, it is not good
                        to prove that she had had no connection with her husband. Why? Because, say
                        the lawyers, the first fact cannot be proved otherwise—the latter can. See

                            explosives. The police found the person who sold the horse which drew
                            the wagon, the grain merchant whose grain the horse ate, the individual
                            who sold the wagon to the conspirators, the barrelmaker whose barrels
                            were used to store the explosive powder, and the storekeeper who sold
                            the blue smocks that the conspirators had used to disguise
                            themselves.</note></p>

                        such a confession were only the effect of a trouble of mind, or of despair.”

                        not inquire any farther into the matter. Does he deny half and confess half?
                        They do not punish him for what he confesses, and abstain from inquiring, as

                        that operates upon conduct—the strength of expectation given, the fact is
                        indifferent—but strength of expectation is proportional—to what? To the
                        constancy of the fact, and to nothing else.</p>
                    <p>Good, says Paley, to extend the punishment of death to a great many crimes;
                        while you inflict it only on a few. You thus <del>bring</del> point the
                        greatest degree of terror against the commission of crimes, without the
                        cruelty of a great many executions.</p>
                    <p>This is setting at defiance the principle of certainty—the opinion that more,
                        in point of intensity of terror, is gained by certainty, than magnitude of
                        the threatened pain.</p>
                    <p>The effect of disproportionate punishment is not to increase the horror at
                            <del>great crimes</del> small crimes, but to weaken it at great ones—not
                        to lessen the number of small—but to increase that of great. <del>Arbitrary
                            power of the judge</del> The reason is—that the man about to commit the
                        crime, by the known laws of human nature, fixes his attention much more
                        strongly upon the chance of escape, that [<emph>sic</emph> than] upon the
                        direfulness of the punishment. Whenever a man is violently prompted by any
                        passion, the tendency of it is, that every circumstance recommending the
                        gratification of the passion is swelled in the imagination to its largest
                        possible dimensions. Every thing dissuading it is diminished to its lowest
                        possible. The imagination, in the case in hand, busies itself repainting in
                        the strongest colours to itself the chances of escape, in painting in the
                        faintest colours possible the <del>chances of</del> pains of the punishment.
                        From the same principle it is that men always overrate a chance of possible
                        good, and underrate the chances of possible evil. When a man is prompted by
                        the venereal desire, he underrates the pains of the pox, and overrates the
                        chances of escape.</p>

                        any degree of uncertainty would encourage a crime, which being so pernicious
                        to trade would ruin the country. The principle of Paley’s net, then, does

                        he may always escape them; therefore they do little good. No man, however
                        criminal, expects to suffer the pains of hell. The parsons, in screwing up
                        the pains so high, have been obliged to leave so many loop holes, at which
                        to escape from them, that they produce no effect. Good men would be good
                        without them—and the bad disregard them. <emph>Parsons obliged to make loop
                            holes</emph>—why? Because without them, the penalties, if believed in,
                        would have rendered human life so wretched, that men would not have believed

                        founded on this important fact, that men over-rate, each in his own case,
                        the chances of possible good, and under-rate the chances of possible

                        enduring for about 350 years. The jurisprudence which carried on from here,
                        and flourished for about 79 years was far more humane than the earlier one:

                    <p>COURT OF KING’S BENCH<lb/> —<lb/> LUDICROUS WAGERS—</p>
                    <p>Elthom <emph>v.</emph> Kingsman.—This case excited considerable interest, and
                        from its result, will, no doubt, be productive of a very beneficial effect.
                        It was an act of trover, tried before Mr. Justice Park, at Gloucester,
                        during the last Spring assizes, by which the plaintiff sought to recover a
                        watch obtained from him under the following circumstances:—the plaintiff and
                        a person of the name of Brown, were proprietors of certain vehicles in use
                        at Cheltenham, known by the name of “Fly by Night,” which are used in the
                        fashionable season at the celebrated spa, to convey persons from their
                        respective residences to the different assemblies. These persons having met
                        during the last autumn, in company with others, some conversation arose as
                        to their different customers, and the degree of repute which each had
                        obtained. Among other persons mentioned was Colonel Longford, to whom the
                        plaintiff and Mr. Brown laid claim as their patron. This led, as is not very
                        unusual among persons of such a class, to a proposition for a wager, and the
                        plaintiff offered to wager his watch against its value in money, that he
                        would carry Colonel Longford to the assembly that night; Brown objected to
                        this wager, but it was finally agreed that they should wager their watches,
                        the one against the other. The defendant being present he was solicited to
                        become the stake holder, and the watches were deposited in his care to abide
                        the event of the wager. Upon the production of the watches, however, it
                        turned out that the plaintiff’s was worth £15, while that of the defendant
                        was not worth much more than 15s. This circumstance, added to some little
                        reflection on the folly of the wager, induced the plaintiff, after five
                        minutes consideration, to repent of his imprudent speculation, and he stated
                        his determination to rescind the wager, demanding at the same time of the
                        defendant the restitution of his watch. The defendant, considering that the
                        watches were delivered to him upon a specific contract, mutually entered
                        into by both parties, refused to recognize the right of the plaintiff to
                        withdraw from his wager, and detained the watches until the issue of the
                        business was known. It further appeared upon the evidence for the defendant,
                        that Brown before he closed the wager amended it, by laying that “if
                            <emph>he</emph> did not carry Colonel Longford, the plaintiff would
                        not.” This latter proposition proved to be correct, for Colonel Longford
                        having heard of the wager went with neither of these persons, but employed
                        some other man. The defendant upon this issue of the affair delivered both
                        watches to Brown as the winner. The plaintiff in consequence of this brought
                        his action against the defendant, upon the ground that as he had expressed
                        his resolution to abandon the wager before any steps had been taken to
                        decide it, he was entitled to have his watch restored.</p>
                    <p>On the trial, Mr. Campbell, for the defendant, contended, that the plaintiff
                        having entered into a positive contract, and the wager not being an illegal
                        one, he was not entitled to abandon it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Park, however, ruled otherwise; but as doubts were entertained,
                        he suggested the expediency of entering a verdict for the plaintiff, subject
                        to a motion to this court to set aside that verdict, and enter a nonsuit, if
                        his conceptions of the law upon the case were erroneous.—This course was
                        adopted, and during the first four days of the present term, Mr. Campbell
                        moved for and obtained a rule to shew cause why the verdict for the
                        plaintiff should not be set aside, and a nonsuit entered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jervis now appeared to shew cause against that rule—contending, that as
                        the contract in question was not executed, but simply executory, the
                        direction of the learned judge upon the present occasion was perfectly
                        correct. The question put to the jury was, whether before the wager was
                        lost, the watch had not been demanded, and they found the watch had been
                        demanded five minutes after the wager had been made, and of course before it
                        had been lost. The wager made between the plaintiff and Mr. Brown was a
                        foolish one, and the watches were deposited in the hands of the defendant,
                        as stake-holder.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: Was there any discretion vested in the defendant, as to
                        the ultimate issue of the wager?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jervis: If the wager had been lost, the Plaintiff could not have
                        rescinded his contract.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: Was the person in whose hands the watches were deposited
                        to decide whether the wager was won or lost?—Mr. Jervis: That would have
                        been decided by the event. The defendant was merely the stakeholder, and the
                        plaintiff demanded his watch back from him five minutes after the wager was
                        made, and before any step was taken to decide it. The learned counsel
                        proceeded to contend, that the plaintiff had a right under these
                        circumstances to recover back his watch; and cited the case of Taylor
                            <emph>v.</emph> Leudey, 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> East, p. 49, as
                        precisely in point. The marginal note of this case was as follows: “One who
                        had voluntarily offered to pay a sum of money for the use of the poor of the
                        parish, in order to avoid a prosecution by a magistrate, upon a charge of
                        having instigated the escape of a prisoner in custody, for a misdemeanour,
                        which offer was consented to by the magistrate, and the money accordingly
                        paid by the party to the master of the work-house for the use of the poor;
                        may at any rate countermand the application of the money before it is so
                        applied; and may recover it back in an action for money had and
                        received.”</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough in this case distinctly held, that the plaintiff was
                        entitled to recover the money back, on the ground of the countermand, and
                        cited the case of Cotton <emph>v.</emph> Thurland, 2 Wils. 341, 347, as
                        illustrative of his decision.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: If the defendant had not converted the stakes, these
                        authorities are clearly applicable. Does it appear who deposited the watch
                        in the hands of the stake-holder first?—Mr. Campbell: The plaintiff was the
                        first to propose the wager, and therefore the first to deposit his watch in
                        the hands of the defendant.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jervis: The plaintiff and Brown acted in unison; but the plaintiff
                        countermanded the wager before any steps whatever were taken to decide
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: We called four or five witnesses to prove the wager had been
                        fairly lost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Abbott: Mr. Justice Park assumes that the wager was lost, but at
                        the same time the decision could not be known until long after the
                        plaintiff’s countermand.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: I can see no distinction between this case and that of an
                        arbitrator. Before an arbitrator makes his award, the persons by whom he is
                        appointed may countermand his authority. A stakeholder stands precisely in
                        the same situation, and allowing the wager to be legal, either party before
                        the decision is made may rescind, and recover back his stake.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Puller followed on the same side with Mr. Jervis, taking the same course
                        of argument, and further contending, that it was extremely impolitic that
                        the time of Courts of Justice, so important to public interests, should be
                        occupied in the discussion of cases at once so clear, but, at the same time
                        so frivolous.—Lord Ellenborough: I fully agree with you, Mr. Puller, upon
                        the impropriety of having the time of the Judges, appointed for the
                        administration of justice occupied by the discussion of a foolish question,
                        whether a person shall go by this vehicle or that; and that when the Judges
                        attend the assizes, more important topics are delayed by such absurdities. I
                        think that it is against the policy and weal of the realm that such foolish
                        and frivolous matter should be at all recognized by courts of justice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: My learned friend represents the plaintiff, who has brought
                        this foolish action.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: He represents one of two foolish people, whose folly ought
                        not to occupy the time of the court.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell now addressed the court in support of his rule: he contended
                        that as the plaintiff had entered into a specific contract, which was the
                        result of his own proposition, he had no right afterwards to rescind it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Abbott: The plaintiff repented of his contract before any step
                        was taken for its completion; and, as in the case of an arbitration already
                        mentioned, he had a right to countermand it.—Mr. Campbell: This case is not
                        that of a mere arbitration. The defendant was the depositor of the bet—and
                        as the bet was legal, and its legality has not been denied, he was not
                        authorized by law to rescind his contract.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: It comes literally to the question whether such ludicrous
                        subjects are to be sanctioned by the Court or not.—Mr. Campbell: There has
                        been no authority cited, which calls in question the legality of my client’s
                        conduct.—Former decisions, on the contrary, are in my favour.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: I repeat, I consider it a question whether such topics
                        ought to occupy the judicial functions of a court of law?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: Your lordship sees the lamentable situation in which a
                        stakeholder is put.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Abbott: He should have exercised his common sense, and have had nothing
                        to do with the business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: There have been much more ludicrous questions than this
                        entertained by Courts of Justice. There was one case I recollect in the
                        Court of Common Pleas, of an action upon a wager of a rump and dozen.
                            <note>A rump of beef and a dozen of claret.</note></p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: I would not have tried that case. I have no hesitation in
                        saying before all the judges in England, that I would not have tried that
                        case.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Bailey [Bayley]: I remember the case of a wager, which came
                        before me in Cumberland. It was respecting the time to be occupied by two
                        horses plowing an acre of land. The course which I took, was this. I said
                        when all the other cases are tried, if I have time I will take this; but I
                        will not suffer the suitors in important questions to be detained by the
                        trial of a question raised by the idle conduct of any person whatever.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: Do your lordships then lay down as a doctrine, that ludicrous
                        contracts may be revoked?</p>
                    <p>Lord Ellenborough: Ludicrous in the legal sense means sporting—such as a bet
                        in which the public have no interest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: This is admitted to have been a legal bet, and such bets are
                        recognized by the law.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Abbott: I am not quite so clear that this is a legal bet. Here
                        are two persons interested in different carriages, who choose to wager
                        whether a gentleman shall go in one or other of their vehicles without his
                        consent. Now in their attempt to get that gentleman into their respective
                        carriages, and thereby to secure their wager, they may not alone [only?]
                        assault him, but create a disturbance in the public streets, and thereby a
                        breach of the peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: If your Lordships lay down new doctrines, distinct from all
                        former decisions, there is an end of the case. I submit, however, that the
                        wager was legal—the contract was legal also, and that the plaintiff had no
                        right to rescind it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Abbott: The legality of the wager becomes questionable, because a
                        third person, not a party to it, may be inconvenienced by its decision. This
                        may be illustrated by our experience of the manner in which persons passing
                        through Piccadilly are treated by drivers of coaches who proceed from
                        thence, and who act as if they think every passenger must of necessity
                        accompany them to Hounslow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Campbell: I rest my hopes of success on the present occasion upon
                        decisions in former cases of a like nature. It has been distinctly held that
                        legal wagers are contracts which can be enforced by law; and until your
                        Lordships shall decide that this was an illegal wager, I shall maintain that
                        the plaintiff had no right to rescind his contract, and that he ought to be
                        nonsuited.—Lord Ellenborough: In most of the cases, bearing upon this
                        subject, which have been argued, hardly any thing ludicrous has been
                        embodied. In considering the present case, I am clearly of opinion that any
                        bet, the decision of which may deprive a gentleman of the free disposal of
                        himself—or may expose him to improper importunities or interruptions, is not
                        legal. What my learned brother has said in regard to the daily occurrences
                        in Piccadilly is very correct, and perfectly applicable to this case. Every
                        one who passes there is liable to the greatest inconvenience from the
                        importunities of the coachmen assembled, who, as if the passengers had no
                        right to exert a will upon the subject, force them into some vehicle or
                        other to be conveyed to Richmond or Hounslow. Any contract which leads to
                        such a result is clearly illegal. But independent of this, I cannot draw a
                        distinction between the situation of the defendant and that of an
                        arbitrator. He is in all respects an arbitrator to decide what shall be done
                        with the stakes which are deposited in his hands—he is to say who is the
                        winner and who is the loser. Now, an arbitrator may unquestionably be
                        deprived of his authority, if before he has made his award that authority be
                        countermanded: and so in the present case: if, before the wager was decided,
                        the person in whose hands the watches were deposited, received notice that
                        the bet was abandoned, he had no further controul over the deposits, and
                        ought to have returned them to their respective owners. Upon the other hand,
                        I think that the attention of the judges of the land ought not to be
                        occupied in giving effect to ludicrous and foolish wagers of this
                        description, the prejudice of the public interest, by the occupation of time
                        which might be more valuably employed. Under all the circumstances, however,
                        I cannot separate this case from that of an arbitrator, and the authority of
                        an arbitrator is clearly countermandable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Bailey: I am perfectly satisfied that the verdict in this case is
                        right. There was a foolish wager between two parties, which it is at present
                        clear was not legal, because its decision might expose to inconvenience and
                        improper importunity an individual, who was to be made to go by one
                        particular vehicle or another, according to the degree of coercion, or
                        persuasion, used by the parties interested. I am also of opinion with the
                        learned judge who has preceded me, that the time of courts of justice ought
                        not to be wasted in the decision of such ridiculous subjects. It was
                        strongly intimated that if we decided this case contrary to the principles
                        laid down by the learned gentleman who represents the interests of the
                        defendant, that we should be making a new law. That I disclaim. If a new
                        case is presented to my notice, I shall apply my judgement to that new case,
                        and shall apply the law as it exists in the way in which it ought to be
                        applied, and as the case shall strike me. Here, even supposing the wager to
                        be legal, which it was not, the plaintiff clearly had a right to abandon his
                        contract. We have no disposition to break down existing rules, or to depart
                        from former decisions; but no decision has been presented to our
                        consideration which should lead us to a different conclusion, and this shews
                        the impropriety of making general allegations of an intention to infringe
                        upon established principles, when there is no pretence for such an
                        insinuation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Abbott quite agreed in the judgement of his learned brothers. He
                        thought the time of Courts of Justice ought not to be occupied by such
                        frivolous cases; and with regard to the merits of the case itself, he was
                        decidedly of opinion that the wager was illegal, and that independent of
                        this, the plaintiff was entitled, as he had done, to abandon his contract,
                        and was, of course, entitled to regain possession of his watch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Holroyd coincided in all respects with the other Judges, and the
                        rule was discharged.</p>
                    <p>The plaintiff by this decision recovers back his watch, and the stake holder
                        has to pay the costs of suit on both sides.” <note>“Court of King’s Bench.

                            of reason.</emph> “As proud as we are of human reason, nothing can be
                        more absurd than the general system of human life, and human knowledge. The
                        faculty of distinguishing true from false, right from wrong, and what is
                        agreeable from what is repugnant to nature, either by one act, or by a
                        longer process of intuition, has not been given with so sparing a hand, as
                        many appearances would make us apt to believe. If it was cultivated,
                        therefore, as early, and as carefully as it might be, and if the exercise of
                        it was left generally as free as it ought to be, our common notions and
                        opinions would be more consonant to truth than they are; and, truth being
                        but one, they would be more uniform likewise.</p>
                    <p>But this rightful mistress of human life and knowledge, whose proper office
                        is to preside over both, and to direct us in the conduct of one and the
                        pursuit of the other, becomes degraded in the intellectual economy. She is
                        reduced to a mean and servile state, to the vile drudgery of conniving at
                        principles, defending opinions, and confirming habits, that are none of
                        hers. They who do her most honour, who consult her oftenest, and obey her
                        too very often, are still guilty of limiting her authority according to
                        maxims, and rules, and schemes, that chance, or ignorance, or interest,
                        first devised, and that custom sanctifies: Custom, that result of the
                        passions and <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap38vb1"/>prejudice of many, and of the
                        designs of a few: that ape of reason, who usurps her seat, exercises her
                        power, and is obeyed by mankind in her stead. Men find it easy, and
                        government makes it profitable, to concur in establishing systems of
                        speculation, and practice; and the whole turn of education prepares them to
                        live upon credit ever after. Much pains are taken, and time bestowed, to
                        teach us <emph>what</emph> to think; but little or none of either, to
                        instruct us <emph>how</emph> to think. The magazine of the memory is stored
                        and stuffed, betimes; but the conduct of the understanding is all along
                        neglected; and the free exercise of it is, in effect, forbid, in all places;
                        and, in terms, in some.</p>
                    <p>There is a strange distrust of human reason in every human institution: this
                        distrust is so apparent, that an habitual submission to some authority, or
                        other, is forming in us, from our cradles; that principles of reasoning, and
                        matters of fact, are inculcated in our tender minds, before we are able to
                        exercise that reason; and that, when we are able to exercise it, we are
                        either forbid, or frightened from doing so, even on things that are
                        themselves the proper objects of reason, or that are delivered to us upon an
                        authority, whose sufficiency or insufficiency is so most evidently.”</p>

                        that authority of men should prevail with men, either against, or above

                        prejudiced by the simplicity of his person which doth alledge it, but being

                        every law must be judged of by the end for which it was made, and by the
                        aptness of things, therein prescribed, unto the same end. … If the reason,
                        why things were instituted, […] do appear manifestly to be of perpetual
                        necessity, then are those things also perpetual, unless they cease to be
                        effectual unto that purpose for which they were at first instituted.
                        Because, when a thing doth cease to be available unto the end which gave it
                        being, the continuance of it must then, of necessity, appear superfluous.
                        And of this we cannot be ignorant, how sometimes that hath done great good,
                        which afterwards, when time hath changed the ancient course of things, doth
                        grow to be either very hurtful, or not so greatly profitable and necessary.
                        If, therefore, the end for which a law provideth, be perpetually necessary,
                        and the way, whereby it provideth, perpetually, also, most apt, no doubt but
                        that every such law ought for ever to remain unchangeable. Whether God be
                        the author of laws, by authorizing that power of men whereby they are made,
                        or by delivering them made immediately from himself, notwithstanding the
                        authority of their maker, the mutability of that end for which they are made
                        maketh them also changeable. […]. ‘That which necessity of some special time
                        doth cause to be enjoined bindeth no longer than during that time, but doth
                        afterwards become free.’ [L] (Tho. Aquinas [<emph>sic</emph>], I, q. 1.) […]
                        What hath been instituted, upon any special cause, needeth not to be
                        observed that cause ceasing. …</p>
                    <p>Laws are instruments to rule by: and instruments are to be framed, not only
                        according to the general end, for which they are provided, but even
                        according unto that very particular, which ariseth out of the matter whereon
                        they have to work. The end wherefore laws were made may be permanent, and
                        those laws nevertheless require some alteration, if there be any unfitness
                        in the means which they prescribe as tending unto that end and purpose. […]
                        Insufficiency of laws doth sometimes come, by want of judgement in the
                        makers. […] But that, which hath been once most sufficient, may wax
                        otherwise by alteration of time and place.” Hooker, <emph>Eccles.

                    <p>Many people know no reason for good government, but its having anciently
                        existed. This is a fallacy engendered by the notion of hereditary.—A king
                        may acquire a hereditary right to commit abuses —oppression may become the
                        object of hereditary right, murder—plunder, etc.</p>

                        as an agent, ascribing acts—such acts, as if ascribed to men, to the
                        society, would appear unjustifiable, but ascribed to the eulogistic term,
                        pass muster without challenge.—This is the term <emph>Law</emph>, made
                        enormous use of by Blackstone.—The law does this—the law does that.—As to
                        such public oppressions as tend to dissolve the constitution, and subvert
                        the fundamentals of government—“they are cases which the law will not, out
                        of decency, suppose.” p. 237, v. I. “The law ascribes to the king [in his
                        political capacity] absolute perfection,” p. 238. “The law ascribes to him
                        [in his political capacity] an absolute immortality.”

                    <p>7. The absurdities of those who have proposed, at any time, changes, advanced
                        as reasons against the study of change—in the same manner Lord Bacon
                        complains that, the absurd pretensions of philosophers, (see <emph>Nov.
                            Org., l.</emph> I, aph. 87) were held valid reasons to dissuade all
                        attempts to improve philosophy. <note><emph>Novum organum</emph>, B. I,
                                <emph>ibid.</emph>, p. 284: “Yet surely it is not fair that the
                            credit of true history should be lessened because it has sometimes been
                            injured and wronged by fables. Meanwhile it is not to be wondered at, if
                            a great prejudice is raised against new propositions, especially when
                            works are also mentioned, because of those impostors who have attempted
                            the like; since their excess of vanity, and the disgust it has bred,
                            have their effect still in the destruction of all greatness of mind in

                    <p>Before inventions, men think them impossible.—After, they wonder such could
                        have been missed. Tacitus, thought a mixed government of the royal,
                        aristocratical, and democratical kind, an impossibility. No difficulty found
                        in the practice. This an encouragement to new attempts. <note>Tacitus,

                    <p>9. The doctrine of precedents a double faced fallacy, looking both
                        ways.—Nothing but precedents if it is to keep down reform. If declarations,
                        or proceedings of the House favourable to reform are quoted, it is
                        unparliamentary to refer to former proceedings as influencing present

                    <p>It is malignant and unjust to paint public men as corrupt—as worse than other

                        what we affirm no less is—that public men, as well as other men have a
                        private interest and a public interest—and that with 99 out of every 100 of
                        public men as well as of other men the private interest will be pursued at
                        the expense of the public, if proper checks are not applied—the pursuit of
                        private interest at the expense of public by public men—in bad
                        government.</p>
                    <p>1. Boundless praises of the constitution—thinking under that title to cover
                        the abuses under which they cram and fatten, and by a factitious reputation,
                        a borrowed glare, to dazzle the eyes of the people, and prevent them from
                        seeing the spots, the gangrene which bad servants have made to grow upon

                        they form part of it—and if you remove them you bring down the fabric.</p>
                    <p>3. Begging the question a most pregnant fallacy—especially in the covert

                        the ministry condemned, praise the constitution.—Is the weight of influence

                    <p>5. Arguing from the abuse of any thing to the use of it. Abuse of the

                        gr. The politician speculates and infers, from well weighed reasons, what
                        form of government, and what laws will best conduce for the public welfare:
                        the moralist, considers and pronounces (i.e., invents and prescribes some
                        certain theorem or universal rule) what is the duty of a good man in such
                        and such circumstances: the physician examines and determines from reason or
                        experience, the nature, virtues and temperaments of what they call simples
                        […]: And so far these sciences are speculative. But if any one do use these
                        conclusions for the directing of his practice, and attemperate his actions
                        accordingly: If he manage affairs of state according to the prescript of
                        this political theorem; if he live according to that moral precept, if he
                        take or refuse such a plant for the sake of his health; then do these
                        sciences and conclusions become practical. And the same happens in our case.
                        The geometrician demonstrates universally That every triangle is equal to
                        one half a parallelogram upon the same base and of equal height; That a cone
                        is equal to one third part of a cylinder upon the same base and of equal
                        height. Which propositions and rules being universally true, the
                        geometrician finds and approves by speculation, and they may be always used
                        for determining the measure of any triangular area, or for comparing any
                        conical vessel with its circumscribed cylinder. Both these theorems
                        therefore may be called practical, as they relate to use and practice, but
                        they would for that reason be very unfitly divided into speculative and
                        practical. Geometry is one simple science which may be considered in two
                        respects, viz. it is stiled speculative as it is true, and practical as it
                        is useful. The absurdity then of this division is clear.” Barrow’s

                        of the book, which he wrote to his wife as he was dying. It presses upon her
                        three great obligations; and every thing else is lost sight of. The first
                        is, the love and service of God, which we have spoken of already. The second
                        is, the love and service of the king, without any regard to his usefulness
                        or hurtfulness to the public; the king was the blessed Charles the second.
                        The third and last of these great obligations, was the “preservation of the
                        House of Hamilton.” God, the king, and the aristocratical family; these were
                        the sole objects of duty. In paying service to them, all merit was summed
                        up. The rest of the species were cattle. The letter should be quoted, on the
                        proper occasion. The words are memorable. <note>Letter of 1650-51, in

                            just those aspects of party of which Mill was most critical:
                            “Nevertheless, we conceive, that the plan of acting in parties, has its
                            foundation in the necessity of the case, and that it affords the only
                            safe and practical means of carrying on the business of a free
                            country—not, as ignorant men imagine, by a collusion between different
                            juntas of men, but by a mode at once peaceful and effectual, of giving
                            their full influence to different principles. … The power of great
                            families is indeed a most necessary part of the array, to which the
                            people must look for their security against misgovernment.” (pp. 184,
                            192.) Brougham was Queen Caroline’s chief counsel in her divorce case.

                            lordships,—which was unnecessary, but there are many whom it may be
                            needful to remind,—that an advocate by the sacred duty which he owes his
                            client, knows, in the discharge of that office, but one person in the
                            world, THAT CLIENT AND NONE OTHER. To save that client by all expedient
                            means,—to protect that client at all hazards and costs to all others,

                            duties; and he must not regard the alarm—the suffering—the torment—the
                            destruction—which he may bring upon any other. Nay, separating even the
                            duties of a patriot from those of an advocate, and casting them, if need
                            be, to the wind, he must go on reckless of the consequences, if his fate
                            it should unhappily be, to involve his country in confusion for his

                        propositions, the truth or falsehood of which you wish to ascertain, examine
                        whether the definition of the predicate includes the subject, or that of the
                        subject the predicate. If it does, the proposition is an identical one. If
                        it does not, the proposition may be false. As, there is no merit, or virtue
                        without free will.</p>
                    <p>NB All propositions, which they call necessary, are propositions, in which
                        the definition of the predicate includes the subject, or the definition of
                        the subject includes the predicate. Thus, every effect must have a cause. In
                        this cause let effect be defined—if the words include cause, the proposition
                        is identical. Something caused is something caused. If the definition does
                        not include the idea of cause, the proposition may be false. See Priestley’s

                        avowed scheme of the ministry in this kingdom, to destroy all incentive to
                        virtue or restraint from vice. Every man that is not of the established
                        church is obliged to take the sacrament as an oath of his conformity to it,
                        before he can accept any office under the government—not that they who
                        oblige them expect—any more than he intends adhering to this most sacred
                        obligation. By this action, the minds of men, being robbed of that uniting
                        principle of integrity which holds them firmly together, are more easily
                        invaded by all future attacks from the side of interest, and open to
                        corruption. The first break makes way for the inroad of every succeeding
                        vice.—The common people of London, who are indeed subjected to no powers but
                        the secular, are most heinous instances of the mischiefs which the neglect
                        of religious motives brings on a nation. There is at present nothing,
                        however impossible, according to the rules of common nature, that numberless
                        witnesses may not be brought to swear for small sums of money. […] Money
                        being the only thing considered as essentially good amongst the greatest,
                        with[out] regard to the perfections of the mind, it is become a received
                        maxim, that by whatever means riches can be obtained, possession obliterates
                        all shame belonging to it.—Thus, the terrors of another world being totally
                        annihilated, the most monstrous crimes are every day committed. […] The two
                        great engines of government—religion, and the sense of shame—are, in this
                        kingdom rendered useless. To so detestable a degree is affair of perjury
                        arrived, that the legislator, who ought to make and preserve laws against
                        that most destructive of all evils to society, is the very person who bribes
                        his countrymen to that iniquity. The very means which lead to the highest
                        honours are prostituting the minds of the electors to the guilt of perjury.
                        […] They exclaim vehemently against ruling the mind by religious awe. […]
                        But is it more honest and virtuous in a minister, […] to putrefy the minds
                        of a whole people, by the taint of one universal bribery and corruption. […]
                        The natives of England think, that the Italians are cajoled into slavery and
                        loss of their property by priests. And here, the minister buys them, like
                        oxen in the market, to their own slaughter. The latter may be more pleasing;
                        but the people are slaves alike.—This is the present mode of ruling in
                        England; and from such proceedings, what can be expected but gaols filled
                        with felons; highways and public streets swarming with thieves and beggars,
                        and gallows groaning beneath the loads of those that are executed. […]
                        Nothing is more amazing to my apprehension, than that a nation which has
                        struggled so nobly against former invasions of their rights, should now so
                        tamely see themselves sold in their elections of representatives, by the

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap44rb5"/>“The author of the ‘Considerations’ contends
                        very properly that it is one of the first duties a Christian owes to his
                        Master ‘to keep his mind open and unbiassed’ in religious inquiries. Can a
                        man be said to do this, who must bring himself to assent to opinions
                        proposed by another? Who enters into a profession where both his subsistence
                        and success depend upon his continuance in a particular persuasion? In
                        answer to this we are informed, that these articles are no ‘rule of faith’
                        (what! not to those who subscribe them?); that ‘the Church deprives no man
                        of his right of private judgement’ (she cannot—she hangs, however, a dead
                        weight upon it); that it is ‘a very unfair state of the case, to call
                        subscription a declaration of our full and final persuasion in matters of
                        faith,’ though, if it be not a ‘full’ persuasion, what is it? And ten to one
                        it will be ‘final,’ when such consequences attend a change. That ‘no man is
                        hereby tied up from impartially examining the word of God,’ i.e. with the
                        impartiality of a man who must ‘eat’ or ‘starve,’ according as the
                        examination turns out; an ‘impartiality’ so suspected, that a court of
                        justice would not receive his evidence under half of the same influence;
                        ‘nor from altering his opinion if he finds reason so to do;’ which few, I
                        conceive will ‘find,’ when the alteration must cost them so dear. …</p>
                    <p>The judgement of most thinking men being in a progressive state, their
                        opinions of course must many of them change; the evil and iniquity of which
                        the answerer sets forth with great pleasantry, but has forgot at the same
                        time to give us any remedy for the misfortune; except the old women's
                        recipe, To leave off thinking, for fear of thinking wrong. …</p>
                    <p>She (the church of England) claims indeed ‘authority in controversies of
                        faith,’ but ‘only so far,’ says her apologist, as ‘to judge for herself what
                        should be her own terms of communion, and what qualifications she shall
                        require in her own ministers.’ All which, in plainer English, comes to this;
                        that two or three men, betwixt two and three centuries ago, fixed a
                        multitude of obscure and dubious propositions, which many millions after
                        must bring themselves to believe, before they be permitted to share in the
                        provision which the state has made (and to which all of every sect
                        contribute) for regular opportunities of public worship, and the giving and
                        receiving of public instruction. …</p>
                    <p>It is alledged in the ‘Considerations,’ that annexing emoluments to the
                        profession of particular opinions, is a strong and dangerous inducement to
                        prevarication; and the danger is the greater, as prevarication in one
                        instance has a tendency to relax the most sacred obligations, and make way
                        for perfidy in every other. …</p>
                    <p>Our author, good man, ‘is well persuaded, that the generality of the clergy,
                        when they offer themselves for ordination, consider seriously what office
                        they take upon them, and firmly believe what they subscribe to.’ I am
                        persuaded much otherwise. But as this is ‘a fact,’ the reader, if he be
                        wise, will neither take the answerer’s word for it nor mine, but form his
                        own judgement from his own observation. Bishop Burnet complained above 60
                        years ago, that ‘the greater part,’ even then, ‘subscribed the articles
                        without ever examining them, and others did it because they must do it.’ Is
                        it probable, that in point either of seriousness, or orthodoxy, the clergy
                        are much mended since?” Paley, “A Defence of the Considerations on the

                        had a great efficacy. The thought of infinite rewards and punishments would
                        entirely overpower the rewards and punishments which temporal rulers have to
                        bestow, and they who could persuade mankind to believe as they wished them
                        about those rewards and punishments, would be the uncontroulable masters of

                        Horne, Bishop of Norwich, and extracted from it the following curious
                        passages: […] ‘He was persuaded that the system of divinity in the
                        scriptures is explained and attested by their account of created nature;
                        that the Mosaic cosmogony is true; that the bible, in virtue of its
                        originality and inspiration, is fitter to explain all other books than any
                        book to explain it; that literature was hostile to Christianity, and to a
                        right understanding of the scriptures; that the science of metaphysics,
                        mathematics, and ethics, lead directly to deism. Mr. Horne was always
                        convinced that Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Clarke had, by introducing
                        speculations of their own, formed a design to undermine and overthrow the
                        theology of the scriptures, and to bring in the Stoical <emph>anima
                            mundi</emph> in the place of the true God; that heathenism was about to
                        rise again in the world out of their speculations. […]—This suspicion of an
                        evil design in Clarke and Sir Isaac Newton took early possession of the
                        Bishop of Norwich’s mind, and was not changed or shaken through life. It was
                        further confirmed by reports, which he had heard, of the private good
                        understanding between them and the sceptics of their day, as Collins,
                        Toland, Tindal, etc.” Miss Seward’s <emph>Letters</emph>, v. 6, Let. 47.

                            believe any thing.</emph> “And certainly it is no small matter of wonder
                        that those men of the Roman church should pretend learning, and yet rest
                        their new articles of faith upon propositions against all learning; that
                        they should engage their scholars to read and believe Aristotle, and yet
                        destroy his philosophy, and reason by their article; that they should think
                        all the world fools but themselves, and yet talk and preach such things,
                        which if men had spoken before this new device arose, they would have been
                        thought mad. But if these men had, by chance or interest, fallen upon the
                        other opinion, which we maintain against them, they would have filled the
                        world with declamations against the impossible propositions, and the dogmata
                        afilosofa [the unphilosophic dogmas] of their adversaries; they would have
                        called us dunces, idiots, men without souls, without philosophy, without
                        sense, without reason, without logic, destroyers of the very first notions
                        of mankind. But now that they are engaged upon the impossible side, they
                        proceed with a prodigious boldness; and seem to wonder that mankind does not
                        receive from them all their first principles, and credit the wildness and
                        new notions of their cataphysics: for metaphysics it is not. Their
                        affirmatives and negatives are neither natural, nor above, nor besides
                        nature, but against it in those first principles which are primely credible.
                        For, that I may use St. Austin’s [Augustine] words, ‘Nemo enim huic
                        evidentiæ contradicet, nisi quem plus defensare delectat quod sentit, quam
                        quid sentiendum sit invenire.’ [For no-one will contradict this evidence,
                        except the man who is more pleased to defend what he feels than to find out
                        what he should feel.] But I see it is possible for a man to believe any
                        thing he hath a mind to; and this, to me, seems to have been permitted to
                        reprove the vanity of man’s imagination, and the confidence of opinion, to
                        make us humble, apt to learn, inquisitive, and charitable; for if it be
                        possible for so great a company of men, of all sorts and capacities, to
                        believe such impossible things, and to wonder that others do not ‘eandem
                        insaniam insanire,’ [be mad with the same madness] it will concern the
                        wisest man alive to be inquisitive in the articles of his first persuasion,
                        to be diligent in his search, modest in his sentences, to prejudge no man,
                        to reprove the adversaries with meekness, and a spirit conscious of human
                        weakness, and aptness to be abused. But if we remember that Pere Coton,
                        confessor to Henry IV of France, was wont to say ‘that he could do any thing
                        when he had his God in his hand, and his king at his feet’ meaning him at
                        confession, and the other in effigy of the crucifix or in the host, we may
                        well perceive, that they are not such fools but they will consider the
                        advantages that come to their persons and calling, if they can be supposed
                        to make, with pronouncing four words, bread to become God. Upon the
                        reputation of this great thing, the priests were exempt from secular
                        jurisdictions and violence, in the council in Dalmatia held by the legates
                        of Pope Innocent III, A.D. 1199, can. 5. Upon this account Pope Urban II in
                        a council which he held at Rome 1097, against the Emperor Henry IV, took
                        from secular princes the investiture of benefices, and advanced the clergy
                        above kings, because ‘their hands create God their creator,’ as Simeon
                        Dunelmensis reports, lib. 2 Chron. apud Vigner, Hist. Eccles. And the same
                        horrible words are used in the famous book called ‘Stella Clericorum:’ Where
                        the priest is called the ‘Creator of his Creator:’ and thence also infers
                        his privilege and immunity from being condemned. I will not, with any envy
                        and reproach, object to them that saying of a Bohemian priest, against which
                        John Huss wrote a book on purpose, that ‘before the priest said his first
                        mass, he was but the son of God, but afterward, he was the father of God,
                        and the creator of his body.’” Jeremy Taylor’s <emph>Works</emph>, [1822]

                        <note>The title is editorial. These notes may be a synopsis made about
                            1813-15, of some of Bentham’s manuscripts on religion, but less
                            probably, independent notes by Mill for an article. They may have been
                            written at the same time as the material on 80v and 81v as the reverse
                            of one fragment on 54v joins to a fragment on 81r. Some of the points
                            made here, particularly those on pay and the efficiency of the clergy,
                            appear in Mill’s “The Church, and Its Reform,” <emph>London
                                Review</emph>, I (July 1835), 257-95. This may be an attempt to put,
                            as concisely as possible, Bentham’s lengthy argument on the Church of
                            England which he worked on in this period (1811-14), and published in
                            1818 (printed 1817) as <emph>Church of Englandism and its Catechism
                                Examined, etc.</emph> A few of the remarks about remuneration may
                            have come from Bentham’s <emph>Treatise on Rewards.</emph> The notes are
                            on four scraps (six sides) of paper, pasted on 54v or between 54v and
                            55r, including a letter to Mill, and a letter cover addressed to
                            Bentham. The symbol [/] is used at the end of each column or each scrap.
                            ¨, _, etc., have been added before and after the / to indicate the end
                            and beginning of each new side or sheet, the order of which is
                            exceptionally difficult to determine.</note>

                        <p>Ambiguity between [points] 3 and 4 per 39 articles.— <note>Charles I’s
                                declaration before the articles states that “no man hereafter …
                                shall … put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of [an]
                                Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.” An
                                ambiguity of some sort is presented by article XXXIV which states:
                                “It is not necessary that traditions and ceremonies be in all places
                                one, or utterly alike; for at all times they have been divers, and
                                may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and
                                mens manners; so that nothing be ordained against Gods Word.”</note>
                            Articles 19 and 20 inexplicable nonsense. <note>Article XIX ‘Of the
                                Church’ notes that “The visible Church of Christ is a congregation
                                of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached.” It then
                                goes on to condemn the Churches of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Rome.
                                In article XX it is declared that “The Church hath power to decree
                                Rites or Ceremonies … yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain
                                any thing that is contrary to God’s Word written.”</note><lb/>

                            Staffordshire in 1649, educated, first at St. Pauls School, thence
                            removed to Trinity College in Cambridge, and on the 1<hi rend="sup"
                                >st</hi> March 1669 presented to the Rectory of Corringham in the
                            hundreds of Essex. […] But the air of the place not agreeing with his
                            health, he was obliged to put in a curate to supply the living, and came
                            to London, where his knowledge of politics, and of the constitution and
                            history of his country, recommended him to the acquaintance of the
                            principal persons engaged in an opposition to the measures and designs
                            of the court, and particularly the earl of Essex and the Lord Russel,
                            the latter of whom appointed him his domestic chaplain. His “Johan the
                            Apostate” published in 1682, was intended to expose the doctrines of
                            passive obedience and non-resistance, which were carried, at that time,
                            to an extravagant height. […] This provoked the court to such a degree,
                            that he was prosecuted for it, as a very scandalous and seditious libel,
                            and sentenced in the King’s Bench on the 11th of February 168iz3rz, to
                            pay 500 marks for a fine to the King, to find sureties for his good
                            behaviour for a year; and to be committed to the prison of the King’s
                            bench till this be paid and done, and that his book be burnt by the
                            hands of the common hangman.—Being incapable to discharge his fine, he
                            continued in prison, in extremely necessitous circumstances; and there
                            drew upon himself a new persecution in the reign of King James II, by
                            writing and publishing in 1686, “An humble and hearty Address to all the
                            English protestants in the present army.” The sentence which he received
                            was a severe one—to stand in the pillory in Westminster, Charing Cross,
                            and the Royal Exchange, to pay a fine of 500 marks, to be whipped from
                            Newgate to Tyburn. Previously to his suffering, he was degraded in the
                            Chapter House of St. Pauls, on the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of November
                            1686, by Dr. Crew, bishop of Durham, Dr. Sprat, bishop of Rochester, Dr.
                            White, bishop of Peterborough, and several Divines of the city, Dr.
                            Stillingfleet, dean of St. Pauls, refusing to attend on that occasion.
                            He bore the whipping on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of December
                            following, with great fortitude. The revolution restored him to his
                            liberty; and the judgement given against him in 1686 was declared
                            illegal and cruel, and his degradation nul; and the House of Lords
                            presented two addresses to King William recommending him to preferment.”

                            Grote used to produce Bentham’s <emph>An Analysis of the Influence of

                            much about the love and service of God—totally useless—they would talk
                            about laws—making men acquainted with and obedient to them—and to obtain
                            good laws.</p>

                            saved himself, it was cruel in him not to give it. Or, knowing the man
                            would have repented had warning been given, it is agreeable to his
                            justice and benevolence to take the will for the deed.</p>

                            virtue; without the least exercise of his intellectual faculty; a man
                            may have been at pains to exercise his intellectual faculty, and under
                            that sincere exercise may have arrived at wrong conclusions respecting

                        <p>[2] <emph>Compensation</emph></p>
                        <p>As for compensation—none to man, nor devils—to god then. In what sense is
                            compensation made to him?—Why for his injured law—the injured honour of
                            his law is repaired.—What is a law good for but when it is sanctioned by
                            penalties?</p>
                        <p>As for the sanctioning no objection—but why not sanction immediately at
                            the time of the breach? To a certainty there would then be fewer
                            breaches. God thus encourages the breach of his law.</p>
                        <p>But compensation—what does that mean? Not any thing to the law-giver—but
                            to the individual injured. This is the only sense of compensation.</p>
                        <p>The idea of compensation to God Almighty includes the idea of his feeling
                            pain at the affront of being disobeyed and pleasure at the torment of
                            the offender; and these absolutely not ultra-regarding.</p>

                            selfish gratification to himself, but the prevention of evil, by fear of
                            punishment, this is not compensation but Reformation or
                            Example.—Compensation therefore is out of the question in regard to
                            future punishment.</p>

                        <p>With the believers in the eternity of hell torments, this too is an
                            effect, for the production of which hell torments are out of the
                            question, because the thing itself is out of the question.</p>
                        <p>Some say that Hell torments are not eternal—that after a period of
                            reformatory punishment, the tormented beings are restored to
                            happiness.</p>
                        <p>The application of evil is not reformative. It is by gentle treatment
                            that men are reformed. To reform, is to produce a liking to goodness—the
                            application of evil hardens, gives a dislike.—If reformation were the
                            only object, pain would never be the instrument.—But pain is necessary
                            to deter, and therefore pain is applied. We are left, therefore, to
                            determent, as the only object of hell torments.</p>

                        <p>To compensate the enfeebling effect of distance—and unexamplarity —the
                            severity of the punishment must be increased. To produce a given
                            quantity of determent, the quantity of pain promptly and visibly applied
                            needs be much less, than when distant and non-visible. Future
                            punishment, therefore, is prodigality of pain.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to beings in some other state of existence; it may be said
                            that the sight of the sufferings of man for his misconduct may be good
                            to deter them from evil or confirm them in good.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. If liable, very slight punishments inflicted upon themselves,
                            immediately <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap83rd"/>upon transgression would
                            have a much greater effect than the severest upon others. <del>they

                        <p>If not liable at all—the sight of the sufferings of others, of which they
                            cannot partake, must, it is plain, be eminently unthrifty.</p>
                        <p>Future, posthumous punishments are therefore ill-adapted to the

                            being.</p>
                        <p>Objection—if God were to punish every ill act as it is performed, the
                            present life would not be a state of trial.</p>
                        <p>What is meant by a state of trial? Is it not a state in which men, by the
                            practice of virtue, may become good? Why then to punish them immediately
                            upon the fault is the way to make them good.</p>
                        <p>Objection—it is by overcoming temptation that men become good. It is by
                            overcoming temptation that men give evidence of being good. The
                            omniscient being wants not such evidence.</p>

                        <p>“It is a principle constantly laid down by all the expositors of sacred
                            writ, that every part of it must be expounded in such a manner, as to
                            render it consistent with reason, and the known attributes of the deity;
                            and whatever will not admit of that interpretation, cannot be received
                            as of divine authority. If this be true, it follows, that our notion of
                            God and his attributes is not to be drawn originally from the
                            scriptures, but from nature and reason, previously to our study of
                            scriptures, which otherwise would be apt to lead us into dangerous
                            errors. […] It would be absurd to make the divine attributes the rule of
                            interpreting scripture, and yet to take our notion of those attributes
                            from the same scripture: for that would confound the rule with the thing
                            to be tried by it: and like travelling in a circle, instead of carrying
                            us forward, would bring us only to the point from which we set out.”

                            nothing but that just notion, and its clear practical consequences.

                            of nature—if you found them in the experienced order, you would not
                            ascribe them to design. Quære why to man, not God? A fine building—is

                        <p>The character which the mind naturally ascribes to the Deity, does not
                            lead to suppose that good and evil will be distributed in the future
                            life, according as a man has done good or evil to his fellow creatures
                            in this. [Beauchamp, p. 10.]</p>
                        <p>In this life, the Deity does not distribute good and evil to men, in
                            proportion as they distribute it to others. Men do. The good and evil
                            which men can <del>inflict</del> impart, they do most commonly
                            distribute to other men in proportion to the good and evil they do. Not
                            so, the Deity. The goods and evils which he bestows, health, long life,
                            etc. have no dependence upon the usefulness or contrary of his actions.
                            [p. 14.]</p>
                        <p>Experience lays no ground to anticipate happiness in the future life,
                            from good conduct in this. Fancy is fruitful, in the absence of
                            experience. [p. 15.]</p>
                        <p>The leading qualities ascribed to the Deity:—Power, and
                            Incomprehensibility. [pp. 16-17.]</p>
                        <p>Power, which signifies the means of doing us good or evil at pleasure,
                            always imports terror, when we have no security against it. [p. 17.]</p>
                        <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap77vd"/>All our security against evil from the
                            powers of nature, whatever they are, consists in our knowledge, which
                            enables us to employ one of these powers against another. Where we have
                            no knowledge, therefore, we unavoidably expect evil. But of the way in
                            which God will employ his power, what knowledge have we? [pp. 14,
                            16.]</p>
                        <p>We hold him to be incomprehensible, i.e. unknowable. [p. 17.]</p>
                        <p>An agent unknowable, is an agent whose actions follow one another,
                            according to no order, which we can anticipate. Such is the madman. The
                            madman, according as he is incomprehensible and powerful, is an object
                            of terror. [pp. 17-18.]</p>
                        <p>Though the powerful being, who is incomprehensible, may do either good,
                            or evil, and though we necessarily more apprehend from him evil than
                            good, he will nevertheless be an object of eulogy, in proportion to his
                            power. This follows from the nature of praise and blame. [pp.

                    <p>Praise is reward: Blame, Punishment. Praise is intended to make the man
                        pleased with what he has done, and inclined to repeat it: Blame to make him
                        displeased, and to avoid it, or do the contrary. [pp. 20-1.]</p>
                    <p>Blame, the instrument of power: Praise of weakness. The weak man cannot use
                        blame with advantage. The strong will not use praise, when he has the more
                        powerful instrument at command. [p. 21.]</p>
                    <p>The master of the negro praises not his slave for the devotion of his whole
                        being. He praises a free servant for some extraordinary service. He praises
                        an equal, for any ordinary act of friendship: A superior even for
                        civilities. A gracious look from the sovereign calls forth the highest
                        expressions of gratitude. [pp. 22-3.]</p>
                    <p>The gradations of blame takes the contrary course. [pp. 23-4.]</p>
                    <p>Praise is naturally, therefore, great, in proportion as the service is
                        little. Blame is great in proportion as the evil is little. The least
                        omission on the part of the slave receives unlimited blame. The greatest
                        injuries hardly draw forth an expression of dissatisfaction toward him [of]
                        whom we are in dread. [pp. 24-5.]</p>

                    <p>Praise is the instrument employed to derive good, from all that active power
                        of which we have experience. A tendency is thus produced to apply it to
                        power wheresoever conceived. Blame is apt to draw mischief upon us from all
                        that active power of which we have experience. A tendency is therefore
                        produced to abstain from it. [pp. 25-6.]</p>
                    <p>That power of which we have experience <del>guides</del> is taken as the
                        sample of that which we only imagine. <del>in other respects</del> [p.
                        28.]</p>
                    <p>Thirst of power is the passion of the earthly despot. Every thing, therefore,
                        which increases his power, or enlivens his idea of its magnitude, is
                        agreeable to him: the contrary, disagreeable. [p. 28.]</p>
                    <p>The utmost degree of deference; professions of reverence, continually
                        renewed; the exhibition of an incessant desire to perform acts agreeable to
                        him, and never to oppose his will, are the acts of courtship to the earthly
                        despot: and are naturally transferred to the heavenly. [pp. 28-31.]</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap78rc"/>Thirst of power makes the earthly despot the
                        enemy of mankind. His power requires that others should be weak, helpless,
                        ignorant. Their happiness requires the contrary. [p. 29.]</p>

                        They benefit the few, but are hurtful to the many. [p. 30.]</p>
                    <p>The men who are most incessantly employed in professing deference to the God,
                            <del>zeal for</del> conformity to his will, in performing all the acts
                        which imply the highest sense of his power, and endeavouring to make other
                        people have that sense, are the people who are supposed to be most agreeable
                        to the heavenly power, as <del>just</del> those acts would make them most
                        agreeable to the earthly. [pp. 31-2.]</p>
                    <p>Those persons who act as if they had no sense of that power, or in a way
                        calculated to lessen the sense of it in others; above all those who not
                        merely neglect, but deny it, are supposed to be most hated by it. [pp.
                        31-2.]</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap78rd"/>That which makes power to be most felt, is
                        punishment. The Deity, therefore, is supposed to punish dreadfully. [pp.
                        32-3.]</p>
                    <p>The earthly despot exacts obedience, i.e. the immolation of human happiness,
                        in proportion to his power. The sacrifice exacted by his God, is from
                        analogy boundless. [pp. 33-4.]</p>
                    <p>The acts sanctioned by religion are either the acts useful to men, or acts
                        not useful. [p. 36.]</p>
                    <p>For the first, they are not needed. A man is a good shoemaker, not because it
                        pleases God, but useful to himself—he is just, prudent, firm, veracious,
                        because these qualities secure to him good, and save him from evil. These
                        qualities would not expire, though religion were not. What would expire, if
                        religion were not, can be none but acts which are not useful to mankind.

                    <p>This is clear; because all hurtful acts that are known may be prevented by

                            are included in this transcription although they show no evidence of

                            24/6/1813. Folios 64r-66v (all dated 12/5/1813) have the title
                            “Misrule,” and 67r “Theory-Abuse,” which is dated 9/5/1813. These sheets

                        from the beginning. <note>Isocrates, <emph>Panegyricus</emph>, 4-14(42-3),
                            Loeb 123-7: “I have singled out as the highest kind of oratory that
                            which deals with the greatest affairs and, while best displaying the
                            ability of those who speak, brings most profit to those who hear. … In
                            the next place, the moment for action has not yet gone by, and so made
                            it now futile to bring up this question; for then, and only then, should
                            we cease to speak, when the conditions have come to an end and there is
                            no longer any need to deliberate about them, or when we see that the
                            discussion of them is so complete that there is left to others no room
                            to improve upon what has been said. But so long as conditions go on as
                            before, and what has been said about them is inadequate, is it not our
                            duty to scan and study this question, the right decision of which will
                            deliver us from our mutual warfare, our present confusion, and our
                            greatest ills? … {S} ince oratory is of such a nature that it is
                            possible to discourse on the same subject matter in many different
                            ways—to represent the great as lowly or invest the little with grandeur,
                            to recount the things of old in a new manner or set forth events of
                            recent date in an old fashion—it follows that one must not shun the
                            subjects upon which others have spoken before, but must try to speak
                            better than they. For the deeds of the past are, indeed, an inheritance
                            common to us all; but the ability to make proper use of them at the
                            appropriate time, to conceive the right sentiments about them in each
                            instance, and to set them forth in finished phrase, is the peculiar gift
                            of the wise. And it is my opinion that the study of oratory as well as
                            the other arts would make the greatest advance if we should admire and
                            honour, not those who make the first beginnings in their crafts, but
                            those who are the most finished craftsmen in each, and not those who
                            seek to speak on subjects on which no one has spoken before, but those
                            who know how to speak as no one else could. … I, for my part, am not
                            concerned with such men, but rather with those who will not tolerate,
                            but will resent, any carelessness of phrase, and who will seek to find
                            in my speeches a quality which they will not discover in
                        others.”</note></p>

                        writing easily beyond any other of our poets; yet his pursuit of remote
                        thought led him often into harshness of expression. Waller often attempted,
                        but seldom attained it; for he is too frequently driven into transpositions.
                        The poets, from the time of Dryden, have gradually advanced in
                        embellishment, and consequently departed from simplicity and ease.—To
                        require from any author many pieces of easy poetry, would be indeed to
                        oppress him with too hard a task. It is less difficult to write a volume
                        with lines swelled with epithets, brightened by figures, and stiffened by
                        transpositions, than to produce a few couplets graced only by naked elegance
                        and simple purity, which require so much care and skill, that I doubt

                        Whigs about indiscriminate censure of public men.</p>
                    <p>Different degrees of trust in public men should depend on there being
                        different grounds of trust.</p>
                    <p>But the grounds of trust are the two aptitudes, moral and intellectual.</p>
                    <p>Now, all trust in the intellectual depends on the moral, which determines the
                        purposes to which the intellectual is applied.</p>
                    <p>Well; Moral aptitude consists in the state of motives; and that depends on
                        the state of interests. All this is quite indisputable.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, and to wind up the proof, the state of interests on the part of the
                        Whigs is exactly the same as that on the part of the Tories. The people,
                        therefore, have the same reason for distrust in the Whigs, as they have for
                        distrust in the Tories.</p>

                            <del>notorious</del> fact, that it has always governed them, as a body,
                        and individually too, with a small number of exceptions, when he does this
                        too clearly to admit of denial, the lawyers do not attempt to deny, <del>the
                            truth of his position</del> which would be dangerous—No, they turn
                        round, and rail at him, as a man who abuses lawyers.</p>
                    <p>When a man shews, that an assembly destined to protect the rights of the
                        people, is placed in such circumstances, that it has an overbearing interest
                        to betray the rights of the people: When this point cannot be denied, they
                        attempt to save themselves, by calling this, invective against the Borough
                        mongers.</p>
                    <p>When a man shews that <del>in certain</del> public servants are placed in
                        circumstances, in which they have an <del>overbearing</del> interest,
                        opposite to good government; an interest which (with rare exceptions) always
                        has, and is still sure to govern mankind, they cannot deny the fact, nor the
                        experience. But they rail against the exposition, under the name of abuse of
                        all public men without exception.</p>
                    <p>There is a perpetual assumption of mean, or bad motives as the cause of all
                        exposure of the mischievous situations which stand opposed to good
                        government, and of the acts to which those situations have given birth.
                        People do so, for the sake of money: money, either to keep them alive, or to
                        make them rich. Now I should be glad to know, if this is not calumny—if this
                        is not misrepresentation. Are writers—writers without bread, placed in a
                        situation, in which it is their interest to calumniate public men? Is there
                        more to be made by calumniating, than by prostitution to public men? Who are
                        they that they themselves will venture to say make bread by calumniating?
                        Are they half so numerous as those who make it by prostituting themselves?
                        No, No—prostitution is the thriving line.</p>
                    <p>It is curious to contemplate the game of the two aristocratical factions. The
                        Outs impute every sort of bad quality, and bad intention to the Inns
                            [<emph>sic</emph> Ins]. The Ins impute the same to the Outs. Let us take
                        their own authority; that of the one, and that of the other, and club them;
                        we shall then have the authority of public men, for abusing them all. One
                        man may abuse one set, and be perfectly virtuous: Another man may accuse the
                        other set, and be perfectly virtuous. But if any man attacks both; Oh, then,
                        he is black as ink!</p>
                    <p>Write a letter in the manner of Pascal—stating, that in conversation with the
                        Ins I heard the writers applauded who abused the Outs, in conversation with
                        the Outs the writers applauded who attacked the Ins. Per the Outs two sets
                        of wicked writers; the ministerial who attack them alone; those for good
                        government who attack both. No good writers but one sort, those who praise
                        the outs. <note>Samuel Romilly, “Bentham on Codification,” <emph>Edinburgh

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap54rb6"/>Charles I tells the world that his fearing
                        God more than man was the ground of his sufferings. Milton answers, “A good
                        principle, not rightly understood, may prove as hurtful as a bad.” Fear of
                        God may convert itself into the most odious of all human principles. He
                        feared not God, says Milton, so much as he did “his courtiers, and his
                        bishops, who drew him, as they pleased, to things inconsistent with the fear
                        of God.” <emph>Iconoclastes</emph>, § IX. <note>In <emph>The Prose

                        if to do his duty were of courtesy! And the discharge of his trust, a parcel
                        of his liberality! So nigh lost, in his esteem, was the birthright of our
                        liberties, that to give them back again upon demand stood at the mercy of
                        his contribution.” <emph>Eiconoclastes</emph>, § 5.

                    <p>Is it the doctrine of the opposite benches that public men ought not to be

                    <p>But whether it be the doctrine of the constitution, or of the gentlemen
                        opposite, or whether it be not, it is the doctrine of human nature, of
                        reason and of experience.</p>
                    <p>Men have two sets of interests—one common to them with the community—another
                        peculiar to themselves, and very apt to be opposite to that of the
                        community—it is by their private interests that almost all men are governed,
                        in preference to their public.—</p>
                    <p>The gentleman asks, if place be so poisonous a thing that no man can have
                        virtue in it—we ask on the other hand if it be so angelizing a thing, that
                        the moment a man comes into it, he becomes rather more than human?</p>
                    <p>All that I suppose is—that place operates no great change for the better in a
                        man—and then I make pretty sure that the private interests of any set of
                        ministers will be the governing motive—and that if these interests are not
                        checked they will be gratified at the expense of the public. The gentlemen
                        opposite is mistaken, I do not suppose him to be worse now than he was
                        before—but knowing him before, to love his private interests as much as most
                        men while out of place, I doubt not he loves them equally well now. I only
                        take him to be the same man that ever he was.</p>

                        have heard speak of him as a writer, with great respect. Johnson, I know not

                        eminent figure in public life. He expressed himself to the same purpose
                        concerning another law lord, who, it seems, once took a fancy to associate

                        man now has been ten years about town, and has made nothing of it; meaning,
                        as a companion. He said to me, I never heard any thing from him in company
                        that was at all striking; and depend upon it, Sir, it is when you come close

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap58vb9"/>The following observations of Simond, on
                        Burdett’s Tower business, are of some importance. “Neither the ministers nor
                        Sir Francis had probably any fixed plan. His resistance was not foreseen by
                        them or by himself; it grew out of the forbearance of the officer employed
                        in carrying the order into execution. But it has been of service to the
                        ministers. The broken windows, and other excesses of a senseless rabble, and
                        the deeper views of some individuals, suspected by the public, have disposed
                        the indifferent, the timid, and all those who have something to lose, to
                        side with that power which can afford immediate protection to the people
                        against the populace. Walcheren and the Parliamentary Reform are quite
                        forgotten for the present. If Sir Francis had suffered himself to be carried
                        to prison quietly, he would now be looked upon as a martyr of patriotism,
                        instead of an abettor of insurrection. He very unadvisedly dropped the
                        character of an oppressed man; and, instead of sympathy, chose to inspire
                        fear and mistrust. A person of experience in marine insurances has often
                        assured me, that he found assurers were apt to ask a higher premium for sea
                        risks when the day was stormy than in fine weather, let the locality of the
                        risk be ever so distant; and that merchants were likewise disposed to pay
                        more. The idea of danger once awakened in the mind, its equivalent is
                        estimated proportionably. The British ministers will find John Bull less
                        disposed to haggle about the price of personal security,—thanks to this
                        political storm.” On this term, John Bull, the author puts the following
                        note, “This nickname […] seems allusive of a certain ponderousness of body,
                        and mind,—plainness and stubbornness of character,—and courage deemed
                        national; but really that portion of the people I saw lately flying before
                        the charge of a few horse-guards, looked more like a flock of sheep, than
                        that fierce animal.” He alludes to the riot, on carrying Burdett to the
                        tower. He adds; “Mr. Cobbett in his political register of yesterday, would
                        have us believe that the people were unanimous for Sir Francis;—but it
                        appeared to me far otherwise. I was much on the spot, and observed more
                        curiosity than earnestness or interest among the crowd; and I think it very
                        probable that the brick-bat men were not very many, and that the same
                        individuals acted successively at the different scenes of action.”

                        subject of using lenity or severity, in cases of tumult or sedition, some
                        thought that rigours, others that pardon was more proper; and many were for
                        crushing enemies with open force. His lordship said to the king, that his
                        majesty’s <emph>defensive</emph> weapons were his guards; and his
                            <emph>offensive</emph> weapons, the laws; and that enemies were to be
                        resisted by opposing force to force; but to be punished only by law. I
                        remember this saying of his was taken notice of as an admirable temper, in
                        stating the matter of force to the king. And his lordship had a general
                        applause for it. Great men, and Governors, are very propense to err in the
                        notion of power; and out of impatience of opposition and desire of revenge,
                        resort to force, which, early or late, turns the evil upon themselves: And,
                        with these men, any one that argues against such methods is looked upon as a
                        faint friend, or enemy disguised.” North’s <emph>Life of Lord Keeper

                    <p>“The other circumstance I mentioned, as an occasion of their greatness, was
                        the simplicity and modesty of their magistrates, in their way of
                        living—which is so general, that I never knew one among them exceed the
                        common, frugal, popular air; and so great, that of the two chief officers in
                        my time, vice admiral de Ruiter [Ruyter], and the Pensioner De Wit (one
                        generally esteemed, by foreign nations, as great a seaman, and the other as
                        great a statesman, as any of their age)—I never saw the first in clothes
                        better than the commonest sea-captains, nor with above one man following
                        him, nor in a coach; and in his own house, neither was the size, building,
                        furniture, or entertainment, at all exceeding the use of every common
                        merchant and tradesman in his town.—For the Pensioner De Wit, who had the
                        great influence in the government—the whole train and expense of his
                        domestique went very equal with other common deputies or ministers of the
                        state; his habit grave, and plain, and popular; his table what only served
                        turn for his family or a friend. His train […] was only one man, who
                        performed all the menial service of his house at home; and upon his visits
                        of ceremony, putting on a plain livery cloak, attended his coach abroad, for
                        upon other occasions he was seen usually in the streets on foot and alone,
                        like the commonest Burgher of the town. Nor was this manner of life
                        affected, or used by these particular men, but was the general fashion or
                        mode among all the magistrates of the state.” Sir William Temple,

                    <p>The same author remarks that the families who held the offices of government
                        in Holland, were a different class from the [/] mercantile families, and the

                        officers of state, is instructive. “Nor do these families, habituated as it
                        were to the magistracy of their towns and provinces, usually arrive at great
                        or excessive riches; the salaries of public employments, and interest, being
                        low, but the revenue of lands being yet very much lower, and seldom
                        exceeding the profit of two in the hundred. They content themselves with the
                        honour of being useful to the public, with the esteem of their cities or
                        their country.” etc. <emph>Ib.</emph>, p. 139. <note><emph>Ibid.</emph>, pp.

                    <p>“It is hardly to be imagined, how all the violence and sharpness which
                        accompanies the differences of religion in other countries, seems to be
                        appeased or softened here, by the general freedom which all men enjoy,
                        either by allowance or connivance: Nor how faction and ambition are thereby
                        disabled to colour their interested and seditious designs with the pretences
                        of religion; which has cost the Christian world so much blood for these last
                        hundred and fifty years. No man can here complain of pressure on his
                        conscience; of being forced to any public profession of his private faith;
                        of being restrained from his own manner of worship in his house, or obliged
                        to any other abroad. And whoever asks more in point of religion, without the
                        undisputed evidence of a particular mission from heaven, may be justly
                        suspected not to ask for God’s sake, but for his own; since pretending to
                        sovereignty, instead of liberty in opinion, is pretending the same in
                        authority too, which consists chiefly in opinion: And what man, or party
                        soever, can gain the common and firm belief of being most immediately
                        inspired, instructed, or favoured of God, will [/] easily obtain the
                        prerogative of being most honoured and obeyed by men.—But in this
                        Commonwealth, no man having any reason to complain of oppression in
                        conscience, and no man having hopes, by advancing his religion, to form a
                        party, or break in upon the state, the differences in opinion make none in
                        affections, and little in conversation, where it serves but for
                        entertainment and variety. They argue without interest or anger; they differ
                        without enmity or scorn; and they agree without confederacy. Men live
                        together like citizens of the world, associated by the common ties of
                        humanity, and by the bonds of peace, under the impartial protection of
                        indifferent laws, with equal encouragement of all art and industry, and
                        equal freedom of speculation and enquiry; all men enjoying their imaginary
                        excellencies, and acquisitions of knowledge, with as much safety as their
                        more real possessions and improvements of fortune.” <emph>Ib.</emph>, p.

                    <p>Among the causes of Holland’s greatness, he enumerates these three: —“The
                        sale by registry, which was introduced here and in Flanders in the time of
                        Charles the Fifth, and makes all purchases safe.—[…] The lowness of their
                        customs, and easiness of paying them; which, with the freedom of their
                        ports, invite both strangers and natives to bring commodities hither, not
                        only as to a market, but as to a magazine, where they lodge till they are
                        invited abroad to other and better markets.—[…] Low interest, and dearness
                        of land” (that is low rent in proportion to the purchase money) […] “cause
                        money to lie ready for all projects by which gain may [/] be expected, as
                        the cutting of canals, making bridges and causies, levelling down and
                        draining marshes, besides all new essays at foreign trade which are proposed
                        with any probability of advantage.” <emph>Ib.</emph>, p. 200. <note>C. 6.
                            Mill has jumbled the order of the causes.</note></p>
                    <p>Making an enumeration of certain common political errors, he says: “The last
                        I will mention is of another vein;—that if the prince of Orange were made
                        sovereign of the Country, […] he would be a great prince, because this now
                        appears to be so great a state. Whereas, on the contrary, those provinces
                        would soon become a very mean country. For such a power must be maintained
                        by force; as it would be acquired, and as indeed all absolute dominion must
                        be, in those provinces. This would raise general discontents; and those
                        perpetual seditions among the towns, which would change the orders of the
                        country, endanger the property of private men, and shake the credit and
                        safety of the government. Whenever this should happen, the people would
                        scatter; industry would faint; banks would dissolve; and trade would decay
                        to such a degree, as probably, in course of time, their very digues would be
                        no longer maintained by the defences of a weak people against so furious an
                        invader; but the sea would break in upon their land, and leave their
                        chiefest cities to be fisher towns, as they were of old.” <emph>Ib.</emph>,

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap59va2"/>In England, “the servants have very little
                        attachment to those they serve. This disposition seems to take place from
                        the minister, down to the servants of servants of servants. Self is the sole
                        motive; and that never makes a true union between those who serve, and those
                        who are served.—[…] A servant secretly gets a better place […] than with his
                        present master, and leaves him in a month. […] This method of leaving a
                        master suddenly, being no objection, if the servant be tolerably good, he
                        finds another place, and is little solicitous about pleasing those he
                        serves.—[…] In Italy, servants having no dependence but on those they serve,
                        must study to obey and please their masters. That domestic who changes his
                        place often, loses his character, and is reduced to great extremity. He who
                        continues long in one house has, besides his present wages, the hopes of a
                        future supply, by a pension in old age, or at the death of his master. Thus
                        the French and Italians, though not half so well paid as the English, […]
                        are ten times better and more obedient in their service. They strive to
                        please, for the sake of being approved of, and finding provision when they
                        are no longer able to work. Whereas an English servant, knowing he has no
                        future expectations from his master, enjoys the present time, dissipates,
                        and finds no solace by an annual pension in his declining days. In my
                        opinion those of our nation, and of France, are happier than the English.
                        They have every thing for their support which is necessary; and the ambition
                        of their masters clothes them well. Their hearts are at ease; and their
                        actions encouraged by knowing, that faithful service always obtains a reward
                        for old age.” <emph>Ibid.</emph>, Lett. 31. NB This meets some of the

                        <p>“Not a singer at the opera at Paris ever performs an air without being
                            out of tune; and yet the audience appears not the least sensible of it.
                            An Italian porter would rave at such sounds, and leave the theatre
                            instantly, half mad, unless the singer quitted the stage. […] In all the
                            attitudes of the human figure, on the other hand, whether dancing,
                            walking, or in any other polite action […] the eyes of the people are so
                            extremely subtle and distinguishing, that the smallest improper action
                            in a player, the least distorted or ungraceful motion in a dancers limbs
                            is immediately perceived. The eye of a person whose ear cannot
                            distinguish between an instrument in tune, and one not in tune, discerns
                            the least ungraceful movement of the body, and receives much pain from
                            it. […] The ear of a Briton has a great degree of perfection,
                            sensibility, and taste, in regard to the power of music. […] The
                            accuracy, however, of this people in the visual discernment is not to be
                            compared with that of the French. Neither men nor women present
                            themselves with that grace which is spread over all the behaviour of
                            both sexes in Paris.” Angeloni’s <emph>Letters on the English
                                Nation</emph>, Lett. 38. It is curious enough that this sensibility
                            to concords in sound, and to grace in motion, he ascribes to the
                            physical perfection of the ear and the eye. <note>Ibid., II

                            entitled Letters on the English Nation, enumerates the evils under which
                            the English lie for want of auricular confession.—1st. The propensity to
                            suicide arising from the want of the relief which was gained by
                            disburthening the mind—suicide not among the English catholics, nor
                            other catholics—confession to the catholic priest miraculously
                                safe.—2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> the restlessness of the English,
                            arising from mental misery unalleviated by confession. “We see them,”
                            says the Jesuit, “moving from seat to seat in company, with every
                            symptom of the tedium vitæ […] in assemblies without being
                            present—riding and driving from one public place to another in search of
                            new objects. […] For this reason, you see more people on the roads of
                            England than in all Europe, and more uneasy countenances than are to be
                            found in the world besides.” Lett. 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                        <p>“Every people forms the idea of felicity, from what it perceives in
                            itself. The English are not more confident that this island […] is the
                            most inviting spot of the universe, than the Laplander, who freezes
                            beneath the Arctic circle, or the negro who burns upon the torrid sands
                            of Guinea, are of the places of their nativity. […] Custom and education
                            are the basis of our judgements. […] If so, they make us, of consequence
                            dislike or condemn those who differ from us. And, therefore, whilst an
                            Englishman wonders how an Italian can live in a land of popery and
                            slavery, the Italian admires at the English libertinism, and want of all
                            religion and police. To English eyes, our worship is carried into
                            idolatry and arbitrary power; and to Italians their liberty is
                            licentiousness.—Methinks, liberty is but another name for ease; where
                            the mind is in tranquillity under the government where it lives, the
                            inhabitants may be denominated free; at least they cannot be termed
                            slaves, where the chains are not felt.” Lett. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                        <p>“Every Englishman’s notion of happiness is included in riches; for that
                            reason, wherever they travel, they conclude all the world are more or
                            less happy, as they are more or less wealthy. When they speak of the
                            deserted towns of Italy, they talk of their inhabitants as the most
                            miserable of people, because they are not rich. […] When these people,
                            on their travels, see a poor Italian pouring out the warm devotion of
                            his soul before the image of his patron saint, they conclude him a fool,
                            or a deluded bigot, […] not conceiving that the rapture which fills the
                            soul of this devotee is real and effectual joy to him. […] Yet these
                            very men shall approve of the person who […] sweats through the day, and
                            passes the night sleeplessly, or him who demeans himself to act the
                            lowest character to an idol minister, in hopes of gold. […] The
                            idolatrous adorer of gold is frequently, if not always, in one shape or
                            another, deceived; the religious devotee never. […] If we place liberty
                            in the room of happiness, and examine whether the being slaves to the
                            passion of wealth […] is not as painful as being subjected to the
                            religion and laws of monarchic states, taking into consideration the
                            effects of custom, education and belief, shall we not find that these
                            people are as free as the English, at least as easy, cheerful and
                            contented?” <emph>Ibid</emph>. [I 45-7.]</p>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap79v"/>1. Moral obligation arises from the mutual
                        equality of men. All being nearly alike in power, each man is impotent, as
                        compared with all the rest. His whole happiness thus depends on his
                        conciliating a certain measure of their favour. But for this, he must
                        abstain from injuring them. The force which thus restrains him from
                        injurious acts is <emph>moral</emph> obligation.</p>
                    <p>2. The man <del>for</del> of power is exempt from moral obligation. If his
                        power is greater than that of the society, he has nothing to fear from them,
                        and no motive to abstain from injuring them. And as he approaches to this
                        state, he has less and less to fear from the rest. The motives, then, to
                        good conduct in any man are inversely as his power, directly.</p>
                    <p>3. The interest, then, of a man without power, is consentient to that of the
                        society. Give him power, and it is no longer so. By power is meant either
                        the ability of attaining his wishes without the aid or in spite of the
                        opposition of his brethren; or a necessity for their assistance, with the
                        ability to extort it by threats of punishment. In the former case his
                        interest is separate from that of his fellows: in the latter even hostile to
                        it: for the quickest mode of ensuring obedience is by exciting apprehension,
                        and this can only be done by inflicting evil.</p>
                    <p>4. Suppose a society perfectly informed of its own interest, and <anchor
                            xml:id="cpb2scrap79vb"/>distributing its good and ill offices
                        accordingly. Any fresh citizen introduced into this society would have a
                        strong interest in abstaining from gratifications hostile, and performing
                        services favourable, to the well being of the rest. Otherwise he would draw
                        on himself the greatest of calamities, the hatred of the rest.</p>
                    <p>5. If then the community are well informed of their own interest, and the
                        individual knows it, and is aware that they know it, he has ample motive to
                        conform to it, for they can inflict on him any amount of misery.</p>
                    <p>6. All morality, therefore, is resolvable into knowledge. The cause of the
                        good conduct of each man, is a true understanding among all of what is the
                        public interest. For the public, if they know their interest, and proclaim
                        what it is, have always force enough to exact conformity to it. This is
                        Plato’s doctrine (true of all men except the man of power, that virtue is
                        knowledge, and that no one desires bad things, knowing them to be bad).
                            <note>Rest of column 79vb blank. The reader will recognize familiar
                            arguments from Plato’s <emph>Republic</emph> here and below.</note></p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap79vc"/>1. This principle impeaches the fashionable
                        estimate of human actions. The rich, it is said, have nothing to gain and
                        every thing to lose by vicious conduct: the poor risk nothing, and are
                        therefore strongly tempted to do ill when there is any thing to be gained by
                        it.</p>
                    <p>2. Were the premises true, the conclusions would be so. But it is a mistake,
                        arising from the employment of loose language, that the poor man risks
                        nothing by his vicious conduct. The poor, it is said, have nothing and
                        therefore risk nothing. In fact, they risk more than the rich. The greatest
                        pains may be equally inflicted on both: but the poor man must endure the
                        whole penalty, while wealth will often avert or alleviate it.</p>
                    <p>3. No one will contend that pain cannot be inflicted on every man: or that
                        the rich cannot command means, out of the reach of the poor, for alleviating
                        any pain. The poor man has therefore more reason to dread, and a stronger
                        motive to avoid provoking, the wrath of the community.</p>
                    <p>4. Again, the preservation of life is the strongest of motives to crime. A
                        starving man is strongly tempted to steal food. But the community may take
                        away his life, and thus oppose a deterring sanction equal to the strongest
                        temptation. This sanction acts equally on rich and poor, for life is of
                        equal value to both: and even more strongly on the poor, whose means of
                        eluding justice are inferior.</p>
                    <p>5. The motives, then, against crime, act more strongly on the poor than on
                        the rich. If then the poor are more likely to commit crime than the rich, it
                        must be that they have stronger motives in favour of crime, to overbalance
                        the stronger deterring sanction. This opinion we shall now examine.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap79vd"/>6. To some injurious acts, e.g., theft, the
                        poor man is more strongly impelled than the rich, who can by
                            <del>their</del> his own resources command a given measure of physical
                        enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>7. To other injurious acts, the rich are more strongly impelled than the
                        poor. The poor man is beneath the influence of the love of power. Whether a
                        man’s demand for personal luxuries can be satisfied, is questionable. But
                        his appetite for power is insatiable.</p>
                    <p>8. To these crimes, then, which spring from a desire of procuring for a man’s
                        own use a given measure of physical enjoyment, the poor man is more strongly
                        impelled than the rich. To those which spring from a love of power, the rich
                        more than the poor. Now the latter class of injuries are much wider in
                        extent, and much more noxious, than the former.</p>
                    <p>9. (I) They are wider, because the opportunities of the poor to steal, are
                        limited. It must always be done clandestinely, and on a calculation of the
                        chances both of failure and of detection. Moreover, theft is a marked
                        violation of the natural order of things, and the rich, who are the
                        legislators, <del>direct the</del> bend the efforts of the laws against it:
                        and from their limited number, they can easily combine to defend each other
                        from <del>them</del> it.</p>
                    <p>10. On the other hand, as the rich have always had great power over the poor,
                        any abuse of this power excites less attention, being a breach of no
                        standing rule, but merely an improper use of an allowed prerogative. No
                        secrecy, no waiting for occasions, are required: the poor are at all times
                        equally exposed. The chance of failure is nothing: and the punishment is not
                        severe, the rich being the <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap80ra"/>legislators.
                        Besides, the number and dispersed state of the poor prevent them from
                        combining.</p>
                    <p>11. (II) Injuries springing from love of power, are more noxious than private
                        theft. The latter generally gives to the thief much more pleasure than it
                        takes from the owner, and the general insecurity alone necessitates its
                        prevention. But the crimes of the rich against the poor produce great
                        suffering to the poor, very little pleasure to the rich. Besides, the
                        insecurity of the rich, arising from theft, is partially removed by the
                        laws: that of the poor from the oppression of the rich never is at all, and
                        cannot be completely removed. Besides, the thief has no motive to inflict
                        more pain, than is necessary, to obtain his object. But the lover of power
                            <del>will</del> has a motive to inflict the greatest possible pain: for
                        it is on the consequent sense of helplessness and degradation that the love
                        of power finds its gratification.</p>
                    <p>12. The crimes, then, arising from love of power, are more extensive,
                        noxious, and difficult of prevention, than those arising from desire of
                        appropriating a certain measure of physical enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>13. Besides, the lover of power desires faithful dependants as his
                        instruments. These can be secured only by donation. If then he himself be
                        satiated with enjoyment, he has still his dependants to satiate. If then the
                        poor man violates property for home-consumption, the rich man does it still
                        more unsparingly for purposes of donation. And thus our position is farther
                        corroborated.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap80rb"/>14. But waving this argument, all[?] the
                        motives to good conduct in a man are proportional to his weakness. For a
                        poor man ventures on crime only when he has hopes of secrecy. But the power
                        of secret agency is a very great power, and if carried so far that a man
                        could make himself invisible at pleasure, it would render him irresistible.
                        The poor man, then, is tempted to crime, only when, for a time, he is
                        powerful.</p>
                    <p>15. Again, whence comes it if not from the dependence of the poor on the
                        rich, that in the greatest part of the world, and to no small degree in
                        England, the poor patiently submit to the rich, and obey their most
                        burdensome commands. Now if the poor man, when dependant on a master will be
                        completely subservient to him; so if he becomes dependant on the society (a
                        state of comparative freedom) he will be the most punctual performer of all
                        duties which it exacts of him.</p>
                    <p>16. If when conscious of his dependence on the rich, he will sacrifice every
                        thing to obey them then if he becomes dependant on the community, he will
                        have the strongest motive to sacrifice his own interest for the benefit of
                        the community, collectively and singly: and this self denial is virtue.</p>
                    <p>17. Again, if a poor man depends entirely on some rich man, that man’s
                        protection renders him strong with respect to the community to the same
                        extent as his master. If indeed they <anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap80rc"/>knew
                        perfectly their own interest, they have physical force sufficient to compel
                        a primary regard to their interest. But if from want of knowledge or of
                        opportunity, their interest is not simultaneously proclaimed by them, the
                        poor man will be in complete dependence on some rich master, which will
                        swallow up his obligations to the community.</p>
                    <p>18. In this state all societies, America excepted, have as yet been cast. The
                        poor man, dependant on the rich, is to the same extent as his master,
                        independent of the society, and has as little, (tho’ not less,) motive to
                        virtue, as his master. It is not then wonderful if he be not actually the
                        most virtuous man: But <del>if</del> in a well regulated society, the poor
                        man, being more dependent on the society than the rich, would have stronger
                        motives to virtue. <note>About four inches of this column are
                        blank.</note></p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="cpb2scrap80rd"/>1. The community term an act good, if
                        favorable; bad if contrary to their happiness.</p>
                    <p>2. The term <emph>good</emph> is applied 1. to acts which it is the interest
                        of the society that all should perform, e.g. the obligations of justice,
                        veracity and or 2. the acts which it is their interest that only a few
                        should perform for the benefit of the rest, e.g., acts of exalted patriotism
                            <del>and</del> or benevolence.</p>
                    <p>3. The performers of the latter class, render to the society a special
                        service needed only on rare occasions. In order to create a motive for these
                        acts, the society bestows on them more praise than on the strict performance
                        of the universal obligations. It is not that they are more useful, for the
                        deeds dictated by justice are the most useful of all.</p>
                    <p>4. If another motive, e.g., pecuniary payment, be provided for these special
                        services, the extraordinary praise ceases. This shews that it is intended as
                        an incitement.</p>
                    <p>5. These services are almost always performed by the rich: <del>not
                            that</del> and hence we are apt to consider them as more virtuous than
                        the poor,—who seldom merit extraordinary praise.</p>
                    <p>6. It is not that they have less motive, but less leisure than the rich.
                        Their time is almost wholly employed in acquiring the primary comforts of
                        life, which are spontaneously provided for the rich. And as only a limited
                        number of performers is required, competition on the part of the poor is
                        hopeless.</p>
                    <p>7. The only motive to such a service is the desire of influence and power.
                        But unless in a very well-arranged society, the rich have far easier means
                        of acquiring power, and have therefore no motive to these acts: while the
                        motive of the poor is always the same, for they have no other means. The
                        poor, therefore, have stronger motives to virtue than the rich, whether as
                        members, or as peculiar servants of the community.</p>
                    <p>8. At any rate, they cannot have less. For the <del>poor</del> rich man has
                        no motive to it at all, while he has an opportunity to obtain dominion by
                        constraint. Now the poor man, however great his motives to vice, has a
                        motive to virtue when they are taken away. According then, to the most
                        favourable supposition, the poor have as great a motive to virtue as the
                        rich.</p>
