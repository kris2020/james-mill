This project began in September 2008 as part of my PhD research at the University of Sussex. Transcriptions of Mill's commonplace books were recovered from the computer of Robert A. Fenn. These were encoded into TEI-compliant XML and published online as transformed HTML files in an electronic edition available at http://www.intellectualhistory.net since September 2010.

I am making the original XML files used prior to the transformation available here for interested parties who may wish to work with the raw data.

James Mill (1773-1836) was a Scottish philosopher and historian of British India. He was the father of the famous liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806-73), and a disciple of Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). Although Mill published widely in his lifetime, he also kept private notes on a range of subjects in his commonplace books. Five volumes of these books are extant; four are held at the London Library and another at the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE.
