XML-encoded transcriptions of James Mill's commonplace books

This project began in September 2008 as part of my PhD research at the University of Sussex. Transcriptions of Mill's commonplace books were recovered from the computer of Robert A. Fenn. These were encoded into TEI-compliant XML and published online as transformed HTML files in an electronic edition available at http://www.intellectualhistory.net since September 2010.
I am making the original XML files used prior to the transformation available here for interested parties who may wish to work with the raw data.
