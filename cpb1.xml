                        <p>This is the shortest section of the whole text,
                        but not for a lack of interest in the subject on Mill’s part. The title is
                        derived from the scrap title list in <emph>CPB</emph> V. There are some ten
                        items that might suit this theme scattered throughout <emph>CPB</emph> V. In
                            <emph>CPB</emph> II there are also some in the groupings on political
                        reform and on the Whigs <ref target="cpb2ch7">(Ins and Outs)</ref> that
                        might fit here just as well. This material also overlaps that to be found in
                        § 9: <ref target="cpb1ch9">Aristocracy</ref>. One possible reason for
                        Mill’s not completing or extending this topic is that, despite the radical
                        tone of his articles in the last six years of his life in the
                            <emph>Westminster Review</emph> and in the <emph>London Review</emph>,
                        there was a limit to what could be said concerning the corruption of the
                        political system at that time, and given the religious reverence still
                        accorded the king, an open attack on the monarchy and aristocracy was
                        probably self-defeating. It was better to let George IV and William IV
                        tarnish the institution by the nature of their actions.</p>
                    <p>Another reason for non-completion (for which material was clearly available
                        in his notes) derives from the fact that he added a second section on <ref
                            target="cpb1ch3">Liberty of the Press</ref> (3r-19v) around 1818 (if
                        the publishing dates of much of the material in it indicate the time at
                        which it was entered), possibly when he was preparing to write “Liberty of
                        the Press” which appeared in the <emph>Encyclopædia Britannica</emph> in
                        1822. That section effectively removed further space for this one to
                        expand.</p></div>

                        <p>The two sections on <emph>Liberty of the
                            Press</emph> are printed in reverse order from that found in this volume
                        of the CPB: Liberty of the Press I (81r-105v) has little, if any, material
                        later than 1812-13; whereas <emph>Liberty of the Press</emph> II (3r-19v)
                        has quotations from the debates of 1818-19, and a novel published in 1821.
                        Further, the hand of the last three paragraphs of § III betrays the
                        deterioration of Mill’s eyesight of the mid-1820s. This material clearly was
                        used for his <emph>Encyclopædia Britannica</emph> article “Liberty of the
                        Press,” which was published in July 1821 (see the clutch of quotations from
                        here and other sections to be found on p. 267 of the original edition). Mill
                        asked Macvey Napier for permission to write an article on “‘Liberty of the
                        Press,’ or ‘Libel Law’” in a letter of 3/1/1821, and in a letter of
                        10/7/1821 he was “hard at work upon the article … and for that purpose
                        suspended the printing of … Political Economy.”</p>
                    <p>Clearly this material should be read in conjunction with the collection of
                        scraps in <emph>CPB</emph> II <ref target="cpb2ch1">under the same title</ref>. The
                        virtual absence of scraps in <emph>CPB</emph> V reveals Mill’s concern for this
                        issue—nearly every bit had been collected and arranged by him, whereas other
                        topics (such as § I) did not quite engage his attention in the same way. As
                        well, the title list of sections from 89r to 105r of <emph>Liberty of the
                            Press I</emph>, as well as 3r to 9r of <emph>Liberty of the Press
                            II</emph>, to be found in <emph>CPB</emph> II
                        <ref target="cpb2scrap10r2c">10r2c</ref>, is another indication of the care he took with this
                        theme.</p>
                    <p>In a very real sense, this material is but a subsection of the larger
                        Benthamite concern over the proper theory and practice of rewards and
                        punishments (as any reader of the <emph>Encyclopædia</emph> article with its
                        curious emphasis on undue or unmerited praise of public figures, laws, and
                        institutions will discern), but it may also link to the quite different
                        thrust of the need to free radical political and religious (or rather
                        anti-religious) advocacy from the shackles of the omnipresent threat of
                        prosecution for seditious libel by the reactionary Attorneys General of the
                        period. In this age the phrase ‘reactionary Attorneys General’ is, of
                        course, a pleonasm.</p></div>

                            be allowed to speak ill of individuals in their private capacity—2. how
                            far in their public—3. how far of institutions—In each case the question
                            is—what are the instances in which the chance of misdoing from
                            concealment is a greater mischief, than the pain or evil of any sort
                            arising from divulgation, lessened by the amount of prevention which
                            divulgation may produce—in other words, what are the cases in which the
                            amount of good produced by exposure is likely to be greater than the
                            amount of evil? <note>Notes for Mill’s “Liberty of the Press” published

                        <p>It should seem that a defence for a pretended libel might be conducted in
                            this manner—Stating that the law is not very precise on this head, that
                            it is vague, and indefinite; so that with regard to a particular case,
                            it may appear to be partly in favour of a defendant—partly against
                                him—1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> to consider in what respects the law may
                            be said to acquit in the particular instance in hand—And it may be said
                            to acquit by all the favourable decisions antecedently pronounced, and
                            also by all the cases equally strong and notorious unprosecuted—2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to
                            consider the point of utility, whether such acts ought to be made the

                            Defendant, i.e. the decisions against similar acts.—The conclusion would
                            be—Where there is a preponderance of law, in favour of the questioned
                            act—where there is utility in exempting such acts from punishment, what
                            must be the character of the man who arms himself with noxious
                            precedents of law, to do mischief, when he might adorn himself with
                            salutary precedents to do good?</p>

                            —intellectual force—against physical force stands the law of
                            treason—against intellectual force stands the law of libel. The age of
                            ignorance and barbarity was the age of physical force—the age of
                            knowledge and civilization is the age of intellectual force. In the age
                            of physical force, dreadful use was made of the law of treason, while it
                            remained in the vague state of unwritten law. To prevent these bad
                            effects, it was defined by statute.—Quote the endless panegyrics of
                            lawyers, on this statutizing. Blackstone. Gibbs (Sir Vicary) [in] <emph>Horne

                            appearance, is made of libel law, a law still unwritten, still vague,

                            class of men been exposed to suffer by it. The application of the

                                    out, and therefore that which was matter of law in the breast of
                                    the Judges, became, by this statute, a matter of fact in the
                                    breast of the Jury, and that points out what constitutes high
                                    treason. … Here is an express prohibition against [the Courts’]
                                    going out of the words of the statute, or judging anything to be
                                    treason that is not above specified.” Sir Vicary Gibbs,

                            great characters in high situations. “Every thing that has a
                                tendency to make men dislike their rulers, inclines them to
                                insurrection, faction, sedition, anarchy, rebellion,
                                treason.” This is their aphorism. Practical inference—punish
                            for such censures as for sedition, treason, etc. Aphorism
                            false—inference pernicious. When men dislike their rulers, when they are
                            discontented with this or that in their government, they may do any one
                            of two things—1. they may run into sedition—2. they may exert
                            themselves, legally and meritoriously, to procure a redress of

                            former. Who thinks so? Is it I alone? It is all the greatest and best of
                            men whom this country has produced. Locke—[Algernon]
                            Sidney—Bacon—Swift—Burke—Fox—Cambden [William Camden]—Lord Erskine (his
                            pamphlet on the war)—Chatham—Chesterfield. All those have written with
                            great severity against the government—with strenuous endeavours to make
                            their country dislike such and such rulers—such and such measures and
                            institutions of government.—Did these men so write, <del>Knowing</del>
                            believing that their writings had no other tendency, and believing as
                            was true, than to create sedition? <note>This sentence is manifestly
                                defective. Mill possibly meant: <q>“Did these men, believing that

                            from the bar or the bench? Why were not these men punished? Why was not
                            Ld. Erskine punished for his pamphlet on the war—Burke for his
                                <emph>Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents</emph>, etc.?
                            Did these men mean to raise sedition? Was Ld. Erskine a Jacobin—Did Mr.
                            Burke mean anarchy—was Chatham an enemy of social order, legitimate
                            government and holy religion—Was Mr. Locke an incendiary?
                            No—Gentlemen—these great, and ever venerable <emph>patriotes</emph>, did
                            not believe with the lawyers that censorial writings on government had
                            no tendency but to make men seditious. They believed that the natural
                            tendency of such writing was so far from being what the lawyers
                            represent it, that it was directly the reverse—so far from putting an
                            end to the benefits of government, as to lead directly and infallibly,
                            to the increase and completion of those benefits.—Every thing that
                            censures government—tends to make people discontented, has no tendency
                            but to sedition—what an infamous doctrine—a doctrine which puts an
                            extinguisher upon the light of improvement—a doctrine by which
                            Sidney—Locke, Burke—Chatham—Fox—are consigned to infamy.</p>
                        <p>Suppose the judge, upon hearing some censorial discourse upon his own
                            situation, and conduct—should apply the word petulance, or any

                            judge imagines that between the greatness of his station and the
                            littleness of mine the difference is vast, and that there is an
                            incongruity that a little person should utter censure to the face of the
                            great one. But the judge is mistaken. On the present occasion, I am not
                            an ordinary man—I am not in an ordinary situation. In my <del>ordinary

                            law which applies alike to them all, I am not <del>merely an example,
                                but a precedent to all</del> a mere individual, I am a specimen, a

                            is this person of mine alone that is concerned—the particular case only

                            fellow countrymen. In me a law is declared to the English people, in my
                            person an example, a precedent is set—in my cause the cause of the
                            people of England is involved (tried)—were I meanest of the community,
                            were I the vilest of criminals, while the inquisition of the law is
                            passing upon me, the whole community stands represented in my person—in
                            that sense, my lord, the place where I stand is still higher for the
                            moment, than that where your lordship sits—It is in this, my
                            representative capacity, that I speak, and claim the right to speak the
                            truth, and the whole truth—it is in this grand capacity my lord, that
                            what proceeds from my mouth, however disagreeable to your lordship, if
                            true, and decently expressed, loses its character of the address of a

                            the chance of misconduct in the judge—it might be done, by drawing a
                            brilliant picture of the importance of a good judge, and of his
                            duties—the Judge is the very bond of the society—it is for his duties
                            principally—as Hume justly observes, that the whole machinery of
                            government is constructed, but in proportion to the elevation and
                            importance of his office, is the delicacy, is the difficulty, is the
                            arduous task of discharging its duties. Every idea of purity, of
                            discretion, of sanctity, of patience, of moderation, of tender sympathy,
                            of manly firmness, above all of innocence, of disinterestedness, of
                            absolute separation from sinister bias, either from fear or
                            favour—either from love of pleasure or flight from pain, either from
                            love of money, or love of power, a desire to please great men, an eye to
                            favour, etc., etc. It is not enough that</p><pb/>

                        <p>a judge decides cases fairly between private man and private man—it is of
                            still more consequence that he should be of a character to decide fairly
                            between private man and public man, or private man and bodies of public
                            men—that the humbleness of the one should not make him despise him and
                            his pretensions, or the power of the other make them and their
                            pretensions be too much regarded. It is not enough that a judge takes no
                            bribes—he may be guilty of any height of wickedness, and from the basest
                            of personal motives, from a leaning to great men, without receiving, or
                            expecting to receive, money counted into his hand. It is not enough that
                            he would startle at hire in its grossest shape. Temptation is most
                            dangerous when it puts on the fairest outside. An act of injustice
                            perpetrated by a judge from a servile leaning to great men, without any
                            definite advantage as the object in view, but an indefinite idea of the
                            manifold advantages which their power brings, is as mischievous as a
                            false decision bought with a sum of money, bought with a beautiful wife
                            or daughter—And such acts are likely to be infinitely the most
                            numerous—It is under this sort of impression that English judges have
                            always been ready to abet the executive government in its warfare upon
                            the liberties of the people.—Having drawn this picture with the
                            strongest hues and brightest colours, it is then to be said—but this
                            virtue, where is it to be found? Answer—if we depend for it upon
                            individual merit, we shall be disappointed. Men are men—and yield to
                            temptation. One man may be above—a succession of men must be on the
                            ordinary level. To have fair judges, we must depurate the station. The
                            judge must be placed out of the reach of temptation. How is this to be
                            done? Very difficult to be done—Shew its impossibility _difficulty_, by
                            enumerating the interests government has in corrupting him. Our
                            constitution has deemed it impossible to counteract these interests in
                            the breast of the judge. It has not contended with him. It has taken the
                            power of deciding on the persons and properties of the people out of his
                            hands. Your station, gentlemen, is exempt from those interests.
                            Government does not know—you are elected for each occasion—the person
                            whom you try has his choice of you, etc., etc. The constitution
                            pronounces upon the judge, that though independent for salary,
                            irremovable, not taking bribes, he is never likely to be independent in
                            mind—never likely to be without hopes and fears as respecting great men
                            and their favours, which will bind him to their inclinations—Now with
                            regard to the judge against whose biases in favour of the men of power I

                            prefer him to you—in you I expect average virtue—in him were he [a]
                            private individual, were he exempt from all the sinister interests which
                            operate upon him as chief judge, I should expect more than average
                            virtue and intelligence, I should therefore prefer him as juryman to
                            you—but sitting where he does sit, his passions, gentlemen, and his
                            interests, I mean his self-serving interests, (and both his passions and
                            his interests are strong), I know are against me. Could he condemn me,
                            and without blame for it, I expect that he would. My only chance of
                            safety from him is in you. The constitution, from the view of those
                            interests and passions, has taken my fate out of his hands, and placed
                            it in yours—if you slovenly yield it to them, you betray your trust. It
                            must indeed be owned that Juries have in general been a little too ready
                            to yield up this sacred trust; to yield up their decision to the will of
                            the judge, to make him, not themselves, judge of the law and the fact,
                            to let him dictate to them the verdict which they were upon their oath
                            to deliver. This juries, even when fair—when unbiassed, have been too
                            ready to do—When they are chosen by the master packer, for their known
                            servility, where the principal of selection operates upon the speciality
                            of juries, the case is a case of sheer corruption, and flagrant
                            injustice. (To go on with the description of special juries—point out
                            the evils which their subservience to the passions or views of the judge
                            tends to produce—to say, you, gentlemen, know yourselves, whether you
                            are of this description, I cannot—I hope you are not—if so, I am
                            confident I shall convince you—if you are my case is a hopeless one.)

                        <p>The Attorney Generals speech was a very artful _cunning_ one. His client
                            has reason to be well satisfied with him. If the demand of his client,
                            however, be an unjust [one], so much the better he has served his
                            client, so much the worse for the justice of his country. The speech was
                            constructed very logically. It consisted of the two propositions of a
                            syllogism,</p><pb/>

                        <p>paying you adroitly the compliment of leaving the conclusion to you to
                            draw for yourselves. The two propositions were these; the first, that a
                            libel is a monstrous bad thing:—such a bad thing! the worst thing in the
                            world! nothing so bad; the second that this writing of mine is a libel;
                            therefore, gentlemen, it is very plain this writing is a most wicked
                            [one]. Now, gentlemen, I shall not lead you through a train of artful
                            logic to refute this. I trust a plain observation will satisfy the mind
                            of every one of you; for truth carries its own conviction along with it.
                            Gentlemen, I am very sure that this paper is not a wicked thing; I am
                            very sure that neither has it produced any mischief, nor is its tendency
                            to produce any; therefore the Attorney General must reverse his
                            argument. , <del>for either a libel is not the wicked thing he calls it,
                                or this paper is not a libel</del>. You may now tell him, and tell
                            him with confidence, Either, Mr. Attorney, a libel is not that wicked
                            thing which you call it; or if a libel be in reality so exceedingly
                            mischievous as you insisted it was, then this paper, is not as you would
                            have us believe, a libel; because Mr. Attorney, we see this paper as
                            well as you, we understand it as well as you, and we are very sure that
                            this paper is not mischievous; for allowing it, for argument’s sake, to
                            be stronger in the language than the case required, a little extra
                            strength of language is no such atrocious thing. Why, Mr. Attorney, you
                            surely do not wish us, a jury of Englishmen, the constitutional
                            guardians of the liberty of the meanest of our countrymen, you surely do
                            not mean to say to us, and in this court, that to examine the conduct of
                            public men is mischievous, to look into it with the keenest eye, and
                            draw out the most hidden parts of it to public view, whatever be their
                            colours black or white, you surely do not mean to say to us that this is
                            mischievous—but we are very sure that in the paper before us there is
                            nothing done or attempted but this. Mr. Attorney, the case appears to
                            us, upon your own shewing, to be a very plain one. A libel, you define
                            to be a writing the tendency of which is to produce mischief. A writing
                            therefore, Mr. Attorney of which the tendency is not to produce
                            mischief, is not a libel. But the present writing has no tendency to
                            produce mischief—therefore, the present writing is not a libel.</p>
                        <p>(e) <emph>Freedom of Speech not more useful in Parliament than in a
                                Writer</emph>. Liberty of speech is declared to be the right of a
                            member of parliament—but liberty of speech is to no other extent, and to
                            no other end a right of a member of parliament than freedom of printing
                            is to an Englishman. The latter is good for the same purposes the former
                            is. Nor does it appear to me at present that there is any instance in
                            which it is good to indulge freedom in parliament, and in which it is
                            not good to indulge it out of parliament.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Attorney, whose skin is of a nature _texture_ that will not bear to

                            with him. I know what he is thinking. It is like what king James said to
                            the fly—“<hi rend="underline">Have I three kingdoms, and thou
                                    must needs fly into my eye?</hi>” I know to what I

                            wither me. The ancient fable of the Medusa’s head was a very natural

                            looks of the learned gentleman have chilled. His voice—the thrilling
                            voice that wakes the dead—will be enough to freeze my blood. As for the
                            weapons too which he wields, the bolts of Jove, I am far from ignorant
                            of their <del>wide-working</del> power over the inhabitants of the lower
                            world. John Read was no unskilful observer. He was groom of the Chamber
                            to my lord of Kent, when Mr. Noy, the celebrated Attorney General of
                            King Charles 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, died. Some were asking what the
                            king would do for a fit man to occupy his station. “Why,” says John,
                                “I think any man may execute the place. I warrant, said his
                                lord, thou thinkest thou understandest enough to perform it. […] Let
                                the king, said John, only make me Attorney General, and I would fain
                                see that man that durst tell me there’s any thing I understand
                                not.”
                            <emph>Non est bonum ludere cum Diis</emph>. [It is not a good thing to
                            trifle with the Gods.]—Comprehending all this, as I fully did, for I
                            cannot pretend ignorance, I have run heedlessly into the danger of
                            personal offence. What I have to plead is this—that some allowance is to
                            be made for my situation. It <del>is a situation</del> When one’s mind
                            is loaded, heavily loaded, when it is overloaded with such a multitude
                            of thoughts as it now concerns me to have present to mine, I hope it
                            will be considered as somewhat excusable, if every thing is not
                            remembered—if I do not find time or recollection for all that deference
                            to his Majesty’s Attorney General which at another time I should be able
                            to observe. Mr. Selden tells the story of a boy who was leading an
                            unruly calf along, and needing the strength of both his hands to the
                            task. He passed a nobleman without taking any notice, who thereupon
                            rebuked him, and asked him if he knew who he was passing, without
                            shewing his respect. Says the boy, if your lordship will hold my calf, I
                            will pull off my hat. If the Attorney General will only hold my calf, if
                            he will deliver me from the laborious task of this defence, by putting
                            an end to the prosecution against me, I will, like the boy, pull off my
                            hat.— <note>John Selden, <emph>Seldeniana, or the Table-Talk of John Selden</emph>,

                            which thus suddenly forced itself upon me, it was far from my intention,

                            dog—still less, the dog of darkness. It was an image that sprang up to
                            me and appeared <del>not inaptly to represent</del> on the thought of

                            difficult to be sufficiently cautious. I own I have sometimes thought of
                            endeavouring to lay in a little merit with the Attorney General. I
                                <del>could not</del> have often thought of the dying Spaniard, who
                            called the Devil my lord—His confessor was telling him in what tedious
                            ways the devil tormented all those who acted not as the priests desired
                            them—I hope, said the penitent, my lord, the Devil will not be so cruel.
                            His confessor reproved. “Excuse me, said the Don, for calling him
                                so; I know not into what hands I may fall, and if I happen into his,
                                I hope he will use me the better for giving him good words.”

                            is, the wounds he inflicts upon me, tells you how good a man he is.
                            Whatever other virtues he may have, that of friendship to the liberty of
                            the press will not by many people be ranked among them. But this is the
                            only virtue, the commemoration of which is true to the purpose. To talk
                            of other virtues “is like the Fellow that was a great wencher.
                                He” insisted “God would forgive him his lechery, and
                                lay usury to his charge.”

                        <p>The Attorney General [Sir Vicary Gibbs] said when declaiming on the
                            pretended crime of Cobbett in 1810 (when Cobbett was sent to Newgate
                            [15/6/1810])—that if he wanted to enrich himself by any means, there was
                            nothing he would undertake so soon as the business of libelling.—Answer.
                            He had a much better trade by the hand—whether it was the money or the
                            mischief for which he had the greatest affection. The lawyer a licensed

                            upon this preliminary. That a judge may decide contrary to law, is
                            matter of every day’s admission. Every writ of error is an instance of
                            it. But not only may one judge decide wrong, and for once—there may be a
                            series of such decisions, all contrary to law, and running through any
                            length of time.—After illustrating this, one might go on to say—“Their

                                with their manner of thinking, and to treat as criminals all those
                                whom they wish to destroy.” [F] In England, the favourites
                            and courtiers have full power of doing what is here the subject of
                            complaint and indignation, in regard to all men who print, who find
                            fault with the acts of government. Now it is worthy of particular
                            regard, the observation ought to excite supreme attention, that it is in
                            regard to these men, almost exclusively, that the friends of arbitrary

                                Libelling is laudable, when Good done by it</emph>. It is a
                            principle of the law of England, that libelling is laudable, where
                            justice, that is, public good is promoted by libelling. The theory is
                            laid down, and the practice is exhibited in a case of the most important
                            nature—the case of the lawyers themselves. It is a notorious fact—it is
                            matter of universal observation, and on many occasions of lively and
                            general indignation, that the reputations of men, and the still more
                            delicate ones of women, are treated with the most wanton, and
                            unnecessary cruelty in courts of justice. What is the reason they lay
                            down to justify this habitual libelling? Hear Blackstone, vol. 3, p.
                                29—“To encourage due freedom of speech, etc., it hath been
                                holden that a counsel is not answerable for any matter by him
                                spoken, relative to the cause in hand, and suggested in his client’s
                                instructions, although it should reflect upon the reputation of
                                another, and even prove absolutely groundless.” Here is
                            libelling—false libelling expressly declared unmeet for punishment—Why?
                            On account of a certain benefit it produces—the benefit of the liberty
                            of speech in matters of judicature. It is on the same ground</p><pb/>

                                the case in hand, he is then liable to an action from the party

                        <p><hi rend="bold">X</hi> In establishing the limits of a free press, the
                            circumstance of reputation is to be well weighed, and a just estimate
                            made of attacks made upon it. In an age in which the affectation of
                            sentimentality is in vogue, injuries to reputation are estimated too
                            high. We are led by poets, and romancers.—“Who steals my purse,
                                steals trash, etc.” This is very apt to be heard with
                            rapture by the thrilling maiden, or the equally thrilling youth who
                            affects to copy her sentiments. But the law is not entirely guided by
                            these fine feelings. Else why does it not punish the man who steals the
                            reputation still more severely than it punishes the man who steals the
                            purse? The Attorney General has been eloquent on the subject of
                            reputation—he has exhausted the common places of the poets and
                            romancers. Reputation is the dearest possession! The wound to reputation
                            surpasses all other injury.—Gentlemen—we ought to have strong objection
                            to this species of talk. It is, gentlemen, highly contrary to law. It is
                            equally hostile to both its letter and its spirit. So far is the law
                            from saying that the wounding of another’s reputation is the highest
                            crime, that it does not place it among crimes at all—it is but a
                            misdemeanour. As this talk therefore, gentlemen, is highly contradictory
                            to law—what is its tendency, addressed as matter of persuasion to you,
                            who are about to declare the law—it is [<emph>sic</emph> its] tendency
                            is to make you declare against and punish me, in a way and degree not
                            consonant to law.—NB Push this idea. <note>William Shakespeare, <emph>The

                            man—a minister—a king who is dead, is as much libel as to speak against
                            any one alive. Therefore to write with truth the history of England is
                            unlawful. Even Hume was a libeller. For Hume says, speaking of Charles
                            2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and that ministry of his known by the name of the Cabal, “that
                                a formal plan was laid for changing the religion, and subverting the
                                constitution of England, and that the king and the ministry were in
                                reality conspirators against the people.”

                            for public good they prosecute freedom of thought, they themselves
                            display their own falsehood and hypocrisy. It is for <hi

                            that libels are prosecutable. They are not a breach of the peace
                            themselves. Well, then, libels tend as strongly to a breach of the
                            peace, when against a man adverse to administration, as against a member
                            of it. Gentlemen, I say, and am ready to prove, that there are certain
                            papers, in general all ministerial newspapers, which are in the habitual
                            practice of libelling all men obnoxious to administration, which not
                            once, but almost continually publish more violent libels against Sir
                            Francis Burdett, for example, than this for which I am now prosecuted.
                            Gentlemen, I assert, and I challenge contradiction, that not one of
                            these, on any occasion has the Attorney General ever prosecuted.
                            Gentlemen, I know not what courtliness of language might require on this
                            occasion. To me, it appears, that these actions are words—that they
                                <del>irresistibly proclaim</del> declare without the need of a
                            commentary, and to the defiance of gainsayers that it is not the
                            execution of the law which is the object of Mr. Attorney, but the
                            gratification of men in power. The law, when broken against men he likes
                            not, may be broken as much as it pleases. It is only <del>against</del>
                            regarding men whom it is his interest to please, that the execution of
                            the law calls forth his patriotism, his generous efforts.—The objection
                            is—that the cases are different, that to abuse administration, exposes
                            the security of the government. What then, gentlemen, is the right of
                            discussion on the measures of government to be denied us? Are we come to
                            this? Will you listen to doctrine of this sort? On doctrine of this sort
                            will you commit a man to the slow torture and the slow poison of a gaol?

                            Who can know?—No statute—contradictory, ever varying decisions—ten
                            thousand cases equally flagrant passed by, for one punished—who can know
                            when he is safe? My friends, there is a celebrated speech of a great
                            character, on a celebrated occasion, a speech which has been greatly
                            admired, which is exceedingly applicable to the present occasion. It is
                            the speech of Strafford who was tried and beheaded, in the time of
                            Charles. “If I sail on the river Thames,” said he, “and split my
                                vessel on an anchor; in case there be no buoy to give warning, the
                                party shall pay me damages: But if the anchor be marked out, then is
                                the striking on it at my own peril. Where is the mark set upon this
                                crime? Where the token by which I should discover it?” Hume,
                            v. 6, p. 404. In the river whereon writers on government sail, the
                            lawyers have sunk innumerable anchors—but they have put no buoys to mark
                            them out. They run, however, to push us down and drown us, as soon as we
                            have struck. <note>David Hume, <emph>History of England</emph>, c. 54.</note></p>
                        <p>They will tell us, there is any easy way to avoid all these dangers. Oh
                            yes? So there is. Only write in applause of them and other instruments
                            of evil, and all is well. But what if we see a man who, to our eyes is
                            guilty of mischief to his country, and unless his conduct is exposed
                            will continue to work mischief—must we praise him? if so, we must aid
                            him, in ruining our country. While he is perpetrating his crimes, we
                            must stand up between him and the public eye, and spreading out our
                            cloak, skreen him from detection. While theft, while murder is
                            committed, instead of giving the alarm, we must support and conceal.</p>

                            understanding. There may be cases in which his very habits render him

                            its tendency to cause revolt. It is not the thing, but the description

                            Gentlemen, all this is only intended to frighten you. The press is
                            indeed a terrible instrument to evil doers, and there is nothing which
                            they shew themselves unwilling to do, to destroy it. But gentlemen you
                            know America. You know that America is a flourishing country. The
                            Attorney General will not pretend to dispute that. Well, America is a

                            possible to conceive. What does this prove? Does it prove that a country
                            must dissolve where the press is licentious? Oh but, says objection,
                            great inconveniences are felt—men are terrified at the press in America.
                            Supposing they are, what does this prove, that these inconveniences are
                            very terrible? No such thing—for America is, I say, the most flourishing

                                innocent</emph>. They talk of a free press having a dangerous
                            tendency to excite insurrection among the people. Gentlemen, this is
                            talk—flatly contradicted by experience. Of all countries in
                                <sic>those</sic> where there has been freedom of the press has
                                <sic>have</sic> been the least disposed to insurrection. The only
                            countries where in the world there ever has been any freedom of the
                            press, have been the protestant countries of Europe—Holland, Geneva,
                            Switzerland, England! Have these, or have they not been the countries
                            the most disposed to insurrection? Of all parts of Europe, that which
                            has been the most distinguished by insurrections has been Italy and

                            in its operation upon the interest of society. If we see that it is not,
                            we cannot believe them. Well then let us try their conduct by the fact.
                            There are two classes of crimes by the press, praising
                            misgovernment—blaming misgovernment. Which has been productive of the
                            greatest mischief to society? the praise. Yet who has ever seen them
                            prosecuting the praise.—They may say, there is no law for punishing the
                            praise. What law is there for punishing the dispraise? Only the will of
                            a train of judges—and that is what I have just been observing, that, of
                            two sets of actions, hurtful to society, they have willed to punished
                                <sic>punish</sic>, the least noxious, and not willed to punish the
                            most. This they would erect into a reason of their conduct. Their own
                            conduct is the reason to itself. They are to be allowed to justify
                            themselves by their own wrong.</p>
                        <p>We come now to another part of the Hon. Gentleman’s speech—the part where
                            turning aside from the crime he is endeavouring to fix upon me, he lays
                            hold of my person and loads it with all the injury he can think of. I am
                            a low person. It seems that is a crime. I am a miserable scribbler. Who
                            am I? Some one that nobody ever heard of. Gentlemen, were all his talk
                            on this subject, mere insult and nothing more, I hope you will believe
                            me when I say, it would cost me very little effort entirely to neglect
                            it. But, gentlemen, without desiring to fix your attention upon the
                            indecency of such a conduct; upon the total want of all gentleman-like
                            feeling which it implies, upon the insult that is offered to justice,
                            when a man stands up as one of her sacred ministers, and instead of
                            confining the attention of you my judges, to the fact of what he would
                            make you believe my crime, turns aside into the path of vulgar abuse,
                            and loads my person with epithets which are as alien to the question in
                            hand, as if he had called me sodomite, or thief, I entreat you gentlemen
                            to reflect upon the injury which such language is calculated and was
                            intended to do me in your estimation. It was foreseen that the more vile
                            you could be made to regard me, the less reluctance you would feel in
                            giving me up to them [to] crush me. If I am so low and the Attorney
                            General so high, can you find in your hearts to prevent them from
                            treading upon me? But gentlemen I call upon you to determine, whether
                            allowing me to be as low as the Attorney General would have you believe
                            me, I ought to be insulted with that lowness. I am low and the Attorney
                            General is high. Is it his doctrine that the low are fit to be insulted;
                            and it is the right of the high to insult them? I desire you gentlemen
                            to determine further, whether because I am low, I am not entitled to
                            justice. Gentlemen, observe—The perpetual cry of the persons who pursue
                            the courses that are pursued by the Attorney General is the people are
                            disaffected; that they are in a conspiracy against the great. But
                            Gentlemen only consider and settle it with your own reason, if the
                            doctrine of the Attorney General is a doctrine which is going to be
                            acted upon—if because a man is low, the Attorney General is to be
                            employed to insult him.</p>

                        <p>(Here suppose the Attorney General to get up and deny with indignation
                            that he had insulted)—then go on—Gentlemen, there is no use contending
                            against this. The Attorney General wants you to reject the evidence of
                            your very senses. Had he come and spit and <sic>in</sic> my face and had
                            then turned round, and said to you, gentlemen of the jury, I know that
                            the rascal before you is going to say I spit in his face—but he is a
                            liar, I tell you so before hand; so upon your peril be it, if you
                            believe him, he would have acted a part exactly similar to that which he
                            has acted now. Perhaps the Attorney General thinks he is as much
                            entitled to your credulity as the woman to that of her husband. He found
                            her in bed with her gallant. She began to upbraid [her husband] as a
                            calumnious, injurious man, that wanted to ruin her reputation. But said
                            the amazed husband did I not see you with my own eyes? What, said she,
                            believe your eyes, “before your own sweet wife?” So says
                            the Attorney General. What Gentlemen of the jury will you believe your
                            own ears before your own sweet Sir Vicary <note>Gibbs</note>? Gentlemen
                            what I was stating to you, when the learned Gentleman interrupted us
                            was, what in my opinion it is of great importance for you to attend to.
                            It is this, that by this verdict of yours today, you are going to
                            produce very extraordinary effects—You will prove by it to the people of
                            England whether they have really cause to be disaffected or not. The
                            doctrine of the Attorney General is not to be concealed; it has gone
                            forth and it is not in the power of chicane and impudence to make it be
                            misunderstood. He has evidently talked to you this day, as if a man for
                            being low is the more entitled to condemnation in a court of justice.
                            Gentlemen, if this doctrine is to be acted [upon], if juries are brought
                            into that state of servility, that they can be induced to bring in
                            verdicts upon this principle, I say, what I shall not benefit my cause
                            by saying—but I shall benefit my country by saying it, and therefore I
                            will say it—if even juries are to be no protection against a doctrine of
                            this sort, then all complaints of disaffection among the people, if not
                            unnatural, are at least unreasonable to the last degree of impudence. If
                            jurors are to be told by servants of the Crown, that they are not worthy
                            of equal justice with their superiors […]</p>

                            libelled in this manner—Did I ever say so, etc., etc. )</p>
                        <p>My lord, I should like to know, whether, if the Attorney General should
                            say that black is white, and white black, your lordship would command us
                            to believe him? My lord, I will put this business between him and me
                            upon a short issue. Either he meant it to have an effect upon the jury,
                            or he meant it to have none. Will he acknowledge, that what he talked
                            about my lowness was mere impertinence, intended to have no effect at
                            all upon the jury? In that case, my lord, I do say, he ought to have his

                            vested with a most important office in the temple of justice <del>to

                            victim; I do contend my lord, that a grosser insult offered to the face
                            of justice than this it is not possible to be guilty of—Is this not to
                            expose courts of justice to contempt? If they open their doors to
                            conduct like this, what is the world to think of them? This is one part
                            of the alternative, my lord, on which I put the Attorney General. The
                            other is, that if what he said was intended to have an effect upon the
                            jury, his language did express to the full amount, the whole of the
                            meaning I have ascribed to it. It did say to the jury, in emphatic
                            terms; this man is a low man and that is one reason why you should
                            condemn him. Gentlemen, is this a doctrine that is fit to be heard? If
                            so, is it to [be] desired that the people should not be disaffected? But
                            what I have to desire of you gentlemen, and what your country has to
                            desire of you, is to spurn such doctrine, from whatever quarter it
                            comes, and when it comes from a quarter calculated to draw disgrace upon
                            the courts of justice, to do what you can by your verdict to counteract
                            the pernicious effects which it is so well calculated to produce. I
                            entreat you gentlemen, to consider whether it is not high time to make a
                            stand—Whether it does not appear to you that things must have gone no
                            short way out of the right course, before a public officer of government
                            would dare to stand up, and in the face of the public, produce a
                            doctrine like this? Must it not have been supposed that the yoke was
                            very strongly fixed upon the necks of a people who could hear with
                            patience a doctrine of this tendency? It is worth your endeavouring to
                            recollect too, what was the sort of temper with which it was heard in
                            this court—what sort of indifference or indignation—of surprise or
                            callous familiarity, it seemed to indicate—it is worth your while, I
                            say, to think of all this, and decide as you may think in such
                            circumstances will promote the good of yourselves as members of the

                            honest—not sober, a liar, etc., etc. This is to them of the last
                            importance—little less than the difference between life and death. Why
                            is this allowed? because it is useful. But is it more useful to have
                            every chance we can for good servants than to have every chance we can
                            for good governors?—Collect all the instances of this sort.—Another
                            is—advocate’s license to expose characters. Another is the license to
                            ridicule an author, for his writings. Ld. Ellenborough’s doctrine, in

                        <p>7. Gentlemen, in what I mean to say to you, upon the nature of libel, I
                            will appeal to your own sense of right and wrong for the justice of my
                            doctrine. I begin with this principle, from which I think you would not
                            wish to swerve—That about what it is clearly of advantage to the nation
                            that <del>there (it) should know every thing about, that the truth
                                should not be concealed, then truth can be no libel crime. Where it
                                is injurious to the nation, that there should be no dis</del> there
                            should be freedom of speech, freedom of speech ought not to be punished:
                            Where it is injurious to the nation, or to individuals without
                            benefiting the nation, <del>that the truth (freedom of) should not be
                                spoken</del> to use freedom of speech, it ought not to be permitted.
                            In fact the rule of use to the nation, or injury to the nation, ought to
                            be the rule of guidance for the press. It is this rule which I meant to
                            steer by in my humble address to you this day, and I should be glad to
                            know whether we are agreed about it in the outset—Whether we are agreed
                            that no man’s feelings should be spared, where it is visible the nation
                            is to be sacrificed by sparing them—whether where no good can arrive to
                            the nation any man’s feelings ought to be put to the torture. This is
                            the line of distinction I want to be drawn between the Attorney General
                            and me.</p>

                            touched by any thing else, were touched with his satires! Here was a
                            man, so far from being ashamed of wounding the feelings of high men,
                            that he accounted it the glory and consolation of his life, that he

                            unfortunate for me, gentlemen, that the matter available for my defence,
                            is matter that can be justly estimated by none but minds enlarged and
                            instructed enough to take in both the widest views and the most refined.
                            It is in itself neither obscure nor complicated, but it involves the
                            interests of society, both on the largest scale, and by the most refined
                            modes of working. It is easy for the Attorney General to accuse—his task
                            lies within a narrow compass. He has only to call this writing libel,
                            and to collect a sufficient number of phrases expressive of great danger
                            and mischief, and his business is done. But gentlemen, the defence of a
                            writing, pointing out faults in the practice or system of government
                            requires much. It requires that you should be made to see, how much the
                            goodness of government depends upon the utmost freedom allowed in
                            pointing out such faults. The very laws of society and of human nature
                            must be held up to view, to shew the irrefragable dependence of the
                            blessings of government upon the freedom of pointing out where it fails
                            to produce the blessings it ought to produce. I must bespeak, therefore,
                            gentlemen, and do hear <sic>here</sic> most earnestly implore your
                            attention, and even your patience, while I exert myself to present those
                            things to you in what I conceive to be the proper light. I shall
                            carefully abstain from every thing not essentially necessary to my
                            defence—but as you see the extent of the subject, I trust you will
                            protect me in the use of the arguments which it requires. You may be
                            assured it will be my earnest desire to make no unnecessary demand upon
                            your time and attention. But as I conceive that the very vitals of human
                            happiness depend upon this question, and as this cause, if you do what I
                            conceive to be your duty, may do much to placing it on a proper basis,
                            for ever, you will excuse my anxiety to do every thing within the limits
                            of my power, to present to your minds all that I think conducive to
                            forming a right judgement on the question. All that I am afraid of is
                            myself. There is in the cause itself wherewithal not only to determine
                            your consciences with the <del>brightness</del> clearness of the noon
                            day sun, but to warm your bosoms with the steadiest advice in favour of
                            that best friend of human nature, a free press. But I shall deliver
                            myself so imperfectly; my powers are so feeble, and my want of practice
                            in this kind of exertion, is so complete, that I am afraid I shall
                            rather betray than defend the cause. Had I but the talents and
                            experience which are this day exerted against me, and unhappily against
                            the cause, what a flame of holy, of consecrated zeal, consecrated to the
                            good of humanity, should I kindle within you.</p>

                                <emph>Parl</emph>. <emph>Debates</emph>, v. 14, p. 758) he says:
                                “With respect to the abuse of patronage, one of those by
                                which the interests of countries will in reality most suffer, I
                                perfectly agree, that it is likewise one, of which the government
                                properly so called, that is to say, persons in the highest offices,
                                are as likely to be guilty, and from their opportunities, more
                                likely to be guilty, than any others. Nothing can exceed the
                                greediness, the selfishness, the insatiable voracity, the profligate
                                disregard of all claims from merit or services, that we often see in
                                persons in high official stations, when providing for themselves,
                                their relations or dependents. I am as little disposed as any one to
                                defend them in this conduct. Let it be reprobated in terms as harsh
                                as any one pleases, and much more than it commonly
                            is.”—Here, the rule of propriety set by Windham is not what will
                            hurt a public man’s feelings—let his feelings be hurt in the harshest
                            manner, but where they really deserve to be hurt—the only question,
                            then, is, when do they deserve to be hurt? when is it that his conduct
                            is pernicious? <note>Debate on Mr. Curwen’s Reform Bill (26/5/1809), in

                            it is for you to consider what mischief the country sustains, from the
                            operation of this terror upon the press; while every man writes with
                            fear and trembling; and no man dares to lift his voice against abuse.
                            Abuse finds its protection. Abuse cannot easily be praised. It is safe
                            if it is only not exposed. The practical consequences are these; as far
                            as praise is not likely to be seen to be mendacious, the prostitutes
                            praise every day: as far as abuses go any man must hold his tongue. A
                            false picture is thus held up. Men are incited to love what very often
                            they ought to hate—and thus the country is misgoverned.</p>

                                free Press</emph>. To conclude then, Gentlemen, if it is your
                            opinion that good government is not a thing to be contended for—that a
                            people may have a good government who do not themselves watch over
                            abuses—that a people can check abuses without a press as free as to be
                            enabled without fear to point them out, why then you may gratify the
                            enemies of the freedom of the press, and consign me over to them to be
                            punished.</p>

                            natural enemies of the freedom of the press. Men do not like to have
                            their faults pointed out; and the very use of a free press is to point
                            out the faults of public men. Even the most vigorous and upright minds
                            are warped, in spight of themselves, and often unknown to themselves, by
                            their private feelings. No man is more ready to believe in the sincerity
                            of the judge on the bench than I am, when he says he is a friend to the
                            liberty of the press. Were a <del>bill to be brou</del> direct
                            proposition to be made to abolish it, I have no doubt that he would
                            resist it to the sacrifice of his life and fortune. Gentlemen, I have
                            confidence enough in his firmness, to believe that he would be crucified
                            with his head downwards, rather than submit to it. Yet gentlemen, I
                            consider him, and in the most dangerous way, an enemy to the liberty of
                            the press. His speculative principles are for it, but his practical
                            feelings are against. He sees it is a good thing to have and would be a
                            dreadful thing to want, but he dislikes every instance of the use of it;
                            and would be extremely willing so to deal with each of those instances,
                            as would produce the same effects with a hatred instead of a love of it
                            in the gross. Think not that I imply personal censure in this—No feeling
                            is more general in the minds of all of us, and more operative upon our
                            conduct, than a dislike to be found fault with. It is hardly possible to
                            avoid a dislike of the instrument which is employed in so disagreeable
                            an operation. When a judge sees other public functionaries found fault
                            with in a way which would to himself be extremely disagreeable, and
                            feels how liable he is to meet with the same treatment every day, he
                            feels as if the case were his own. He regards the man who has acted this
                            bold or severe part, as in some measure his own enemy. Really,
                            gentlemen, I cannot wonder at any man’s feeling so. I am but too
                            sensible how likely I should be to feel in the same manner. In taking
                            our precautions against these feelings, therefore, we have no right to
                            think disrespectfully of the individual. I can conceive a man to have
                            much private and public virtue, and yet dangerously biased by these
                            feelings. I own, too, gentlemen, that persons in the situation of
                                <del>the jud</del> public functionaries are liable to be spoken ill
                            of unjustly. This, I own, naturally appears to them a provoking
                            circumstance; and no man, is more ready than I am to acknowledge it is
                            an evil. But we cannot open the door to the pointing out of real faults,
                            without letting in some false ones. We cannot</p><pb/>
                    </div>

                        <p>have the good with out an admixture of the evil, it is very clear. There
                            are measures which may be taken to lessen the evil. We cannot shut the
                            door upon the false imputations without shutting it equally close upon
                            the true. To the chance of wrongful aspersion, therefore, public
                            functionaries must make up their minds. It is one of the taxes which
                            they must pay to the good of the state. But it is very natural for the
                            persons who have to pay this tax, to grumble at the burthen of it. It is
                            very natural for them to exaggerate in their own minds the magnitude of
                            the evil. With regard to the press, an instrument so liable to create
                            their uneasiness, it is very natural for them, to keep a minute register
                            of all the evils it is liable to produce; to paint them to their own
                            minds in the most formidable colours, and thus to be desirous of
                            lessening its powers. I am far from desiring to dissemble, too, for
                            truth only, I wish to be my safeguard, that what lately happened in
                            France, has operated but too naturally, to increase apprehension of the
                            evils arising from the mischiefs of the press. It would be difficult to
                            say that the press had no share in the evils there produced. Every
                            thing, which is calculated to be an instrument of much good, may in
                            certain unhappy circumstances, be an instrument of much evil. Religion
                            itself, to what dreadful purposes has it been turned? A standing army,
                            to what dreadful purposes has it been turned? The kingly state, what
                            dreadful uses have been made of its power? Courts of justice, what
                            instruments of barbarity have they been rendered? But the press was not
                            the cause of the evils of the French revolution—pursue this. Those evils
                            have given strength to the dislike which public functionaries have felt,
                            and have made the people to concur with it more. Injustice of this—But I
                            expect the judge’s private feelings to be against me. His speculative
                            principles are for me, but his practical feelings are against me; and
                            these will lead him to draw you if possible against me too. But it is
                            your business, and his lordship will tell you so as well as I; that it
                            is your business to attend to his reasons, not to give way to his
                            feelings. As far as he can make it appear to you, that I have done, and

                            intimidation is equal to an extinguisher on the liberty of the press. If
                            we are to believe a celebrated doctor, and a celebrated doctrine, it is
                            the most effectual means of extinguishing that can be devised. Paley
                            says, make a <del>law so severe</del> severe law, and extend it to a
                            great many cases, in which it is unfit to be executed. Execute it in a
                            few of the worst cases. You hang the terror of the severe punishment
                            over all. This is the best way of preventing crime. See, to the same

                        <p>Nothing would please those who are inimical to the press, but that it
                            should either be silent—or at least never speak any thing but in praise
                            of the government. If we speak very generally, and say that good
                            legislation would produce mighty advantages, would improve the condition
                            of mankind, render happiness general, universal. We are told this is
                            reports of court proceedings, not libellous, theory—abstract
                            speculation—on which no practical conclusion can be founded. If we
                            descend to particular facts in the state of government, and exhibit a
                            picture of the evils which flow from [it], this is a seditious
                            libel.</p>
                        <p>Opposition by speaking and writing to the institutions of the state,
                            attended with no danger. The church is a part of our constitution; and
                            every day, in the most authoritative quarters, we hear it stated as a
                            necessary part. If a proposal was ever made to <del>correct</del>
                            redress the abuse of tithes, we should hear tithes defended as a thing
                            without which king and lords could not stand. Well then, this church is
                            written against, is spoken against, and assemblies are permitted to be
                            made to hear it abused, and yet no evil is done.</p>
                        <p>Were I on the jury, and his lordship should tell me this were a libel, I
                            should listen to him with candour, and respect, but without the smallest
                            degree of conviction or assent.</p>
                        <p>22. Lord Keeper North’s remonstrance against prosecution for libels. Said
                            that counter writing was the weapon—and that when the government had
                            justice and reason on its side, that was sufficient. Corollary—then
                            every government that prosecutes for libel is conscious to itself of
                            pursuing bad ends. Rule—In proportion as a government engages in acts of
                            prosecution of the press, in that proportion it is to be suspected of
                            bad designs. <note>Roger North, <emph>The Life of the Right Honourable Francis

                        <p>The Attorney General tells you I am a low man—he has spoken of me in
                            terms of great contempt. I think you ought to consider, you, my real
                            judges, what purpose this proceeding of the Attorney General is
                            calculated to serve. To call your attention to the offence with which he
                            has thought proper to charge me, and to turn it to your view on all
                            sides, this may be his duty, but to attempt to degrade my person in your
                            eyes, and the public eyes, to take advantage of a situation where he may
                            without fear of punishment do me so much injury, and to employ it for
                            the purpose of vilifying me in the face of the public, in the face of a
                            court, calling itself a court of justice, I desire you and the public to
                            consider, in common justice, what this means. Mr. Attorney has an
                            opportunity of speaking after me, and I have no opportunity of reply,
                            and if you are not men of discernment, which it is not possible for me
                            to know, he may mislead you to any extent, to my great misfortune or
                            utter ruin. In his reply, he will deny that he has vilified me, or that
                            he had any intention to do so. When he says this, it is your business to
                            consider the words which he used, and what was their natural tendency—to
                            take the meaning they conveyed to your own ears, not that which, for
                            conveniency, he may give to them. If he did not seek to vilify me, why
                            talk of my lowness? Is lowness the crime with which he charges me? The
                            gentleman, he will say, is very angry with me, for calling him low—and
                            then I expect he will sneer at me, and endeavour by sarcastic affected
                            apology to make you despise me and admire him still farther. I desire
                            you to observe all this. I desire you as Christians, <del>called to
                                determine between man and man</del> coolly to weigh it and form your
                            own judgement. Be not in a hurry. Think how you would like to be treated
                            so yourselves. There is another thing he may do—finding these usual ways
                            of injuring a man in my situation pointed out more distinctly to your
                            understandings than he might wish, he will very likely fly out into a
                            sort of passion, and will say, what? Am I to be deterred from doing my
                            duty by what he shall say? Does he think, by his sophistry, (for he will
                            give what I say all manner of bad names) to mislead me from fulfilling
                            my duty? Gentlemen, when you hear this, just take time to ask yourselves
                            what is his duty? Is it his duty instead of keeping your attention upon
                            the crime, on which you are to decide, to carry it to my general
                            character, or my situation in life, on which surely you are not called

                        <p>punishments. A man may be punished in his person, in his property; or he
                            may be exposed to an infamizing punishment, as the pillory, and then he
                            is degraded in his reputation. The latter, among a civilized people, is
                            reckoned not the least severe kind of punishment. Gentlemen whatever may
                            be your verdict with regard to the truth or falsehood of my accusation;
                            whatever may be the opinion of the judges with regard to the degree or
                            kind of punishment, which, if you pronounce me guilty, I may deserve,
                            the Attorney General is resolved I shall not escape punishment. He is
                            resolved to be beforehand with both judge and jury. Without either trial
                            or sentence, antecedently indeed to both, he chuses to inflict a
                            punishment upon me at his own discretion. His hands are held in regard
                            to my person or property—but unhappily in regard to that other point on

                            my family may receive injury to any conceivable amount, he uses his own
                            discretion in shaping the measure of my punishment, and I have no

                        <p>“Not many years ago an action was brought in the Court of Common
                                Pleas by Mr. <emph>Currie</emph> against <emph>Walter</emph>,
                                proprietor of ‘The Times,’ for publishing a libel in the paper of
                                ‘The Times,’ which supposed libel consisted in merely stating a
                                speech made by a counsel in this Court on a motion for leave to file
                                a criminal information against Mr. <emph>Currie</emph>: Lord Chief
                                Justice <emph>Eyre</emph>, who tried the cause, ruled that this was
                                not a libel, nor the subject of an action, it being a true account
                                of what had passed in this Court; and in this opinion the Court of
                                Common Pleas afterwards, on a motion for a new trial, all concurred,
                                though some of the judges doubted whether or not the defendant could
                                avail himself of that defence on the general issue. Though the
                                publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage of the
                                particular individual concerned, yet it is of vast importance to the
                                public that the proceedings of Courts of Justice should be
                                universally known. The general advantage to the country in having
                                these proceedings made public more than counterbalances the
                                inconveniences to the private persons whose conduct may be the
                                subject of such proceedings. The same reasons also apply to the
                                proceedings in parliament: it is of advantage to the public, and
                                even to the legislative bodies that true accounts of their
                                proceedings should be generally circulated; and they would be
                                deprived of that advantage if no person could publish their

                        <p>Jonathan Wild’s speech against the folly of the different parties of
                            public men, exposing one another by their quarrels, about the
                            principles, i.e. the hats which they wore. B. 2, ch. 6.</p>
                        <p>“‘Gentlemen, I am ashamed to see men embarked in so great and
                                glorious an undertaking as that of robbing the public, so foolishly
                                and weakly dissenting among themselves. Do you think the first
                                inventors of hats, or at least of the distinctions between them,
                                really conceived that one form of hats should inspire a man with
                                divinity, another with law, another with learning, or another with
                                bravery? No, they meant no more by these outward signs than to
                                impose on the vulgar, and instead of putting great men to the
                                trouble of acquiring or maintaining the substance, to make it
                                sufficient that they condescend to wear the type or shadow of it.
                                You do wisely, therefore, when in a crowd, to amuse the mob by
                                quarrels on such accounts, that while they are listening to your
                                jargon, you may with the greater ease and safety pick their pockets:
                                but, surely, to be in earnest, and privately to keep up such a
                                ridiculous contention among yourselves, must argue the highest folly
                                and absurdity. When you know you are all <emph>prigs</emph>, what
                                difference can a broad or a narrow brim create? Is a
                                    <emph>prig</emph> less a <emph>prig</emph> in one hat than
                                another? If the public should be weak enough to interest themselves
                                in your quarrels, and to prefer one pack to the other, while both
                                are aiming at their purses, it is your business to laugh at, not
                                imitate their folly. What can be more ridiculous than for gentlemen
                                to quarrel about hats, when there is not one among you whose hat is
                                worth a farthing? What is the use of a hat, farther than to keep the
                                head warm, or to hide a bald crown from the public? It is the mark
                                of a gentleman to move his hat on every occasion; and in courts and
                                noble assemblies no one ever wears one. Let me hear no more,
                                therefore, of this childish disagreement, but all toss up your hats
                                together with one accord, and consider that hat as the best which
                                will contain the largest booty.’”

                                consequence but a majority in parliament—though they have totally
                                lost all power but that of provoking. Fortunate it had been for the
                                king and kingdom had the court had no majority for these six years!
                                America had still been ours!—and all the lives, and all the millions
                                we have squandered! A majority that has lost thirteen provinces by
                                bullying and vapouring, and the most childish menaces, will be a
                                brave countermatch for France and Spain, and a rebellion in Ireland!
                                In short, it is plain that there is nothing a majority in parliament
                                can do, but outvote a minority. … Nay they are so pitifully mean as
                                to laugh at doctor Franklin, who has such thorough reason to sit and
                                laugh at them. … In truth, it is a compliment to any man to except
                                him out of the number of those who have contributed to the shocking
                                disgraces inflicted on this undone country. … I have, I own some
                                comfortable reflections. I rejoice that there is still a great
                                continent of Englishmen who will remain free and independent, and
                                who laugh at the impotent majorities of a prostituted parliament. …
                                What will be the issue of this chaos, I know not, and probably shall
                                not see. I do see with satisfaction, <hi rend="underline">that what

                            shew pride or arrogance. But this, I trust, I may say, without offence,
                            that workmen such as I am, if you put me out of the way, you will not
                            find in great numbers—a man who has sacrificed every thing, ambition,
                            pleasures, wealth, to the study of what is good for mankind; and who
                            braves the neglect and even displeasure and vengeance of great men, in
                            telling faithfully to his countrymen, what he thinks for their good.

                                follows:—“Our pirated laurels, with which the French have so
                                much reproached us, have been exceedingly pruned! Braddock is
                                defeated and killed, by a handful of Indians and by the baseness of
                                his own troops, who sacrificed him and his gallant officers. Indeed,
                                there is some suspicion that cowardice was not the motive, but
                                resentment at having been draughted from Irish regiments.—Were such
                                a desertion universal, could one but commend it? Could one blame men
                                who should refuse to be knocked on the head for sixpence a day, and
                                for the advantage and dignity of a few ambitious? But in this case
                                one pities the brave young officers, who cannot so easily
                                disfranchise themselves, from the prejudices of glory.”

                            to H. More Sept. 22, 1788—on the subject of the famous exorcism at
                                Bristol—“Alas! while folly has a shilling left, there will be
                                enthusiasts and quack doctors, and there will be slaves while there
                                are kings or sugar planters. I have remarked, that though Jesuits
                                etc., travel to distant East and West to propagate their religion
                                and traffic, I never heard of one that made a journey into Asia or
                                Africa to preach the doctrines of liberty, though those regions are
                                so deplorably oppressed. Nay, I would doubt whether ever any
                                chaplain of the regiments we have sent to India has once whispered
                                to a native of Bengal, that there are milder forms of government
                                than those of his country—No; security of property is not a
                                wholesome doctrine to be inculcated in a land where the soil
                                produces diamonds and gold!—In short, if your Bristol exorcist
                                believes he can cast out devils, why does he not go to Leadenhall
                                street? There is a company whose name is legion.”

                                effect of it; and in a speech to the clergy, publicly forewarned
                                them, that, <emph>if they did not destroy the press, the press would

                            it some imposture, which is afraid of being brought to light. The way to
                            make governments secure is to strip them of imposture, and not to
                            hoodwink the people. If a government has in it no imposture, why

                                Press</emph>. One grand fallacy lurks at the foundation of the
                            reasonings of those who argue against the liberty of the press. It is a
                            confident assumption of one of the main points that remain to be proved.
                            The assumption is—that <hi rend="underline">to discredit the government
                                is to injure the peace and happiness of the nation</hi>. You cannot
                            speak against the government—you cannot point out a fault in it—or in
                            those who carry it on—without discrediting it; therefore no fault in
                            either ever ought to be pointed out. Either praise, or hold your tongue,
                            or be punished, if you speak. This is Bonaparte’s doctrine.—1<hi
                                rend="sup">st</hi> Let this rule be acted upon, and <del>no
                                amendment can</del> all abuse is remediless. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                            In the next place, to point out faults in the government, leads
                                <emph>not</emph> to confusion and misery; but to amendment of the
                            faults. What are the usual causes of obedience? The chief instances of
                            obedience are, payment of taxes, and submission to judicial decisions.
                            Force is the ground of obedience in both instances. Respect to
                            government, say they, is necessary. Respect means a sense of utility, if
                            it means any thing but superstition. Superstitious respect to
                            government, or to any thing else, as it is folly and weakness, must
                            always produce the fruits of folly and weakness. The proper state of
                            feeling and thinking, in respect to government, in its most</p><pb/>

                        <p>general acceptation is—1. That any government should be held better than
                            no government—2. that the more good should be always held better than
                            the less good.—Government, speaking of it in the abstract, there is no
                            body who does not respect [it]. To preach the virtue of respecting it is
                            as needless, as to preach the virtue of breathing. All men know they
                            want protection; and that but for government they could not receive it.
                            With respect to each government in particular, that <del>in it which is
                                good should be respec</del> when any man <del>finds</del> points out
                            faults in the administration of justice, it is not that he disrespects
                            the administration of justice—when faults of the executive, faults of
                            the legislative powers—it is not that he disrespects these powers. The
                            fallacy consists in two branches: 1. Executive, legislative, judicative
                            powers, are good—therefore every shape in which they appear is to be
                            respected. 2. Every shape in which legislative, executive, and
                            judicative powers appear ought to be respected, therefore [a] man who
                            exercises those powers ought to be respected. The office ought to draw
                            respect to the office holder—this is the grand wish of the office
                            holder. But what is useful to the people? That as little of the respect
                            due to the office, as possible, should be given to the office holder,
                            independent of good behaviour—that respect to the office should be one
                            thing; respect to the holder another thing; and that those two things
                            should be kept as separate and distinct as possible. To whatever degree
                            a man receives respect in an office, independent of good conduct in the
                            office, to that degree is he deprived of all motive to good conduct—and
                            without due motive to good conduct, conduct is sure to be bad. A judge
                            says, you ought to respect justice, therefore you ought to respect me.
                            No—the more I respect justice, the more I may feel it necessary to
                            despise you. It is your interest to identify yourself with your
                            office—but it is my interest, and the interest of justice and truth to
                            keep the two distinct, not to let you confound them, for that is only to
                            furnish you with a screen to misconduct.—The stronger a man’s love to
                            good government the stronger naturally his hatred of bad—criticism of
                            government therefore is so far from a proof that a man wishes to destroy
                            government that it is the very reverse.—The fact is, that it is only by
                            withdrawing respect, from abuses or abuse supporters, that any
                            amelioration, except by physical force, can ever be obtained; so far is
                            it from being true, that this is the way to bring on the use of physical
                            force between the citizens—by physical force you may remove an abuse for
                            which the people retain their respect; by persuasion, it is impossible.
                            No fear that the worst disposed can ever be disposed in any thing nearly
                            like sufficient numbers to destroy the government hence nothing more
                            vile than to call necessary attempts at depopularization inflammatory.
                            What is the whole business of opposition, but to depopularize?—Supposing
                            the press to be without restrictions, even at liberty to publish all
                            imputations, just and unjust, without punishment—members of government
                            would not be without protection. 1. Just defence naturally more powerful
                            than unjust attack—2. The motive of defence, self preservation, much
                            stronger than the motive to attack. 3. In their hands is the whole mass
                            of the matter of reward, set apart for the business of government—Desire
                            supposed to be in mankind to traduce people in authority; this very weak
                            to antagonize with the interests of the greater number which are served
                            by truth, and with the means of defence, in the hands of men of power.
                            This supposed desire is at the bottom of a good deal of the persecution
                            of the press. See for the fallacy of the opinion, <emph>Popular

                                of government to be exposed to dishonouring imputations</emph>.
                            Answer. No man will engage in the business of government with honourable
                            intentions, who does not wish his conduct to be fully scrutinized and
                            laid open to public view. Because, if his conduct is good, it is his
                            interest that it should be known—the more known the more glory. It is
                            only if his conduct is bad, that it is his interest it should not be
                            known. But—for a conduct to be laid open to view, it must be laid open
                            to all imputations, good and bad, under the general certainty that truth
                            when it has equal advantages will always appear for what it is. NB When
                            ever a man seeks to prevent scrutiny, it is circumstantial evidence that
                            scrutiny is against him. It is only when day light is against a man,
                            that a man is for darkness—thieves love the darkness—The objection
                            implies, that no honourable man will serve his country, when there is
                            any inconvenience in doing it. What would be said of the soldier, who
                            should say, no honourable man will be a soldier if he is in danger of
                            being shot at? Such is some men’s professed notion of the motives on
                            which honourable men serve their country. <note>The thieves / night

                                and the monstrous licence that sprung from thence, and they who
                                enjoyed that licence were as unsatisfied with this government as any
                                of the rest, talked more loudly, and threatened the person of
                                Cromwell more than any. But into those distempers Cromwell was not
                                inquisitive; nor would give those men an opportunity, by calling
                                them in question, who, he knew, would say more than he was willing

                            letter to Arbuthnot, in which he expresses his satisfaction at the pain
                            he inflicted by his satires, quoted by Junius, v. I, p. 162. Therefore
                            to torture the feelings of men, may in the opinion of the wisest and the
                            best, be an eminently good thing—Yet this, says Ld. Ellenborough, is the
                            essence of a libel. Liberty of the press is merely the extension of the
                            popular sanction. As far as the exercise of the moral sanction is good,
                            so far is the liberty of the press [good]. As men are deterred from bad
                            actions chiefly by the force of this sanction, to check the liberty of
                            the press is, <emph>pro tanto</emph>, to give a sanction to bad
                            actions—to bad government. <note>Junius, <emph>The Letters of Junius</emph>, 1792,

                            hurt against real merit. “Wit,” says Johnson, in <emph>Swift’s
                                life</emph>, “can stand its ground against truth only a
                                little time.” And in his <emph>life of Pope</emph>. The
                            satire which brought Theobald and [Edward] Moore into contempt, dropped
                            impotent from [Richard] Bentley. Bentley stood uninjured by the united
                            attacks of Swift, Pope and Garth. Ben Johnson [Jonson] vituperated Inigo
                            Jones; but without effect; while he sank Decker [Dekker]. Swift
                            ridiculed Dryden, and ranked him with Tate and D’Urfey. Was Dryden hurt
                            by that? Hurd called Hume “a puny dialectician from the
                                north.” Johnson, Wilkes, Junius, Churchill abused the
                            Scotch; and from that day the admiration of them has been increasing.
                            Johnson abused Ossian. Swift said that Marlborough neither had courage
                            nor skill in war. Canning’s ribaldry against Mackintosh—Southey’s

                        <p>45. It is remarked by the historians of Pericles, that he was strongly
                            exposed to the shafts of ridicule and invective; indeed in a most
                            extraordinary degree. He was played upon the stage, and all the
                            infirmities of his private life ripped up, as well as the most
                            abominable designs ascribed to his administration. It is remarked, too,
                            that not one of his maligners was ever punished for their writings or
                            accusations. Plutarch tells a characteristic story. “A vile and
                            abandoned fellow,” he says (<emph>Life of Pericles</emph>, Langhorne’s
                            Translation) “loaded him a whole day with reproaches and abuse;
                                he bore it with patience and silence, and continued in public, for
                                the dispatch of some urgent affairs. In the evening he walked softly
                                home, this impudent wretch following, and insulting him all the way
                                with the most scurrilous language; and as it was dark when he came
                                to his own door, he ordered one of his servants to take a torch, and
                                light the man home.” When he was attacked for that defensive
                            system of policy which he adopted in the Peloponnesian war, by every
                            kind of accusation of cowardice, folly, treason, “He followed,” says
                            Plutarch (<emph>Ibid</emph>.) “the dictates of his own understanding,
                                unmoved by the clamours of complaints that resounded in his ears.
                                Thus firm he remained, notwithstanding the importunity of his
                                friends, and the threats and accusations of his enemies;
                                notwithstanding the many scoffs and songs sung to vilify his
                                character as a general, and to represent him as one who in the most
                                dastardly manner betrayed his country to the enemy. Cleon too
                                attacked him with great acrimony, making use of the general
                                resentment against Pericles as a means to increase his own
                                popularity, as Hermippus testifies in these verses.”</p>

                            the writings of Reginald Scot (<emph>Discoverie of Witchcraft</emph>,
                            etc.) in which he denied in [<emph>sic</emph>] the existence of

                        <p>We must not be wiser than the laws—say time-serving judges—Then, all
                            improvement in legislation is at an end—all improvement in legislation
                            that ever has taken place, has taken place in consequence of being wiser
                            than the laws. All our best writers have not scrupled, by condemning
                            many of our laws, to declare themselves wiser than the laws; Locke, Adam
                            Smith, Malthus, Blackstone, Price, Priestley, Bishop [Richard] Watson

                        <p>The usual jugglery of double sense, with which the fiends in Shakespeare
                            patter for the delusion of men, is here taken into service. To be wiser
                            than the laws is occasionally meant to express two things. It sometimes
                            means disobedience of the laws; and in this sense it is a bad thing. It
                            most frequently means, seeing an imperfection of the law, and perhaps
                            along with that using laudable endeavours to procure a correction of the
                            error. And this is good. Because the first is bad, the last is not bad
                            also. But to deceive people with the badness of the first, and make them
                            call the last bad also; and so consent to its punishment, is imposture,
                            and wickedness. The punishment of the meritorious—the diminution of
                            good, and the increase of evil is [its] only consequence.</p>
                        <p>46. Juries are called upon to declare, not whether a writing is a libel
                            or not—for what writing is not a libel? but whether it is such a libel
                            as deserves punishment. There are three stages of jurisdiction. 1. the
                            Attorney General determines whether the thing deserves prosecution—2.
                            the jury determine whether it deserves punishment—3. the judges fix the
                            degree of the punishment. That the function of the jury is to determine
                            whether a libel deserves punishment or not, is evident as follows. Every
                            thing which is brought before them is a libel; for every thing which any
                            body dislikes is, by the definition, a libel. As often then as they
                            bring a verdict of acquittal, so often do they decide, that what is a
                            libel does not deserve punishment. It is law, that there are libels
                            which do not deserve punishment, because it is law that the press should
                            be free; but if everything which falls within the definition of libel
                            were punishable, the press would not be free—therefore every thing which
                            is a libel is not punishable according to the English law.— <note>The
                                dictum about a libel being “every thing which any body dislikes” is
                                drawn from Lord Ellenborough’s view, “Punish whatever hurts
                                anybody’s ‘feelings’,” uttered in the trial of the King

                        <p>In confirmation of this doctrine, other legal facts may be produced. When
                            Lord Melville was impeached, he was impeached for a breach of his own
                            law—a breach which was not only proved, but which he himself did not so
                            much deny. But he defended himself, by saying (which I believe was true)
                            that the nation had sustained no injury by that breach. On this defence,
                            and foreseeing that the punishment would go beyond what, (in this
                            instance) they reckoned the value of the offence, the lords pronounced
                            him not guilty.—So the Duke of York, though the acts proved against him
                            were not legal. <note>The Duke of York and Albany, second son of George
                                III, was Commander-in-Chief of the army from 1798-1809. In 1809 he
                                was accused of being influenced by his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke,
                                in the appointment of officers. See <ref target="cpb1ch4scrap56v"

                                in 1805 over his handling of funds as First Lord of the Admiralty.
                                He was acquitted by the Lords in June 1805. The law referred to was
                                the Act “for better regulating the office of treasurer of the
                                    navy” (25 Geo. III, c. 16) of which he had been the

                        <p>The judges—if the liberty of the press is exercised upon the sovereign,
                            are burning hot to punish—if it is exercised upon the army or navy are
                            burning hot to punish—if it is exercised upon the law, are burning hot
                            to punish. Upon looking round to see, if there is any thing whatsoever
                            upon which any degree of liberty is left, we find it is the legislature.
                            There is far more freedom of the press allowed upon that than upon any
                            thing else. The reason is, because there is a contrariety of interests
                            between the legislative and judicative power—the more the legislature
                            does its duty the less of arbitrary power it leaves to the judge. The
                            judge, as such, has little of sympathetic feeling with the legislature.
                            Accordingly the legislature is far worse treated in print than any other
                            department of the government. Yet with all its imperfections it is by
                            far the most perfect part of it; and that, the mere superintendence of
                            which prevents our government, in all its departments, law, army, and
                            navy, from being the very worst in Europe.</p>

                                believers of public falsehoods and calumnies, and shall here speak
                                of that contempt with which they are and ought to be received by
                                those in high stations at whom they are levelled. Any person indeed,
                                who is zealous for promoting the interests of his country, must
                                conquer all that tenderness and delicacy which may make him afraid
                                of being spoken ill of. […] Among a people who indulge themselves in
                                the utmost freedom of thought and speech, a man must either be

                                obloquy, from several motives and reflections. […] A statesman, who
                                is possessed of real merit, should look upon his political censurers

                                aspersions do them honour, at the same time that they are intended
                                to lessen their reputation. […] A virtuous man therefore who lays

                                like the trial of a suspected chastity, which was made among the
                                Jews by the waters of jealousy. Moses assures us, that the criminal
                                burst upon the drinking of them; but if she was accused wrongfully,
                                the Rabbins tell us, they heightened her charms, and made her much
                                more amiable than before: so that they destroyed the guilty, but
                                beautified the innocent.” Addison, <emph>The

                            are not possessed. It is delusion, it is imposture; the object of which

                            Socrates, as sayings of his, upon the subject of libelling, “When
                                he was told that so-and-so spoke ill of him, he replied, ‘True, for
                                he has never learnt to speak well.’ To one who said, ‘Don’t you find
                                so-and-so very offensive?’ his reply was, ‘No, for it takes two to
                                make a quarrel.’ We ought not to object, he used to say, to be
                                subjects for the Comic poets, for if they satirize our faults they
                                will do us good, and if not they do not touch us.” [G]

                            libel is like the law of pains and penalties against the dissenters. It
                            is not enforced—it is not executed in one out of a thousand cases in
                            which it is violated. The reason is, of course, that it is not fit to be
                            executed. If it were, [there is] no Attorney General who would not
                            deserve to be impeached. We are all then agreed that the law of libel is
                            a law which is not fit to be executed except in here and there an
                            instance. What an idea of a law!—The real law is constituted (as far as
                            practice can constitute a law) by the analogy of the cases punished. But
                            really they are so anomalous, that there is no general principle,
                            running through them all, which can be traced. A certain strength or
                            grossness in the expression may at first thought be taken for the mark.
                            But this will not be found answerable. Very great grossness sometimes
                            escapes—very gentle infusions of it are sometimes punished. For the
                            mischief of penal laws, not generally executed, see an excellent

                        <p>The remedy against libel, by information, indictment, is for breach of

                            the injury to the individual. When the man is tried for the injury to
                            the individual it is not lawful to speak of the breach of the peace. The
                            last is seldom or ever done. The former almost always. NB A good deal

                        <p>Gentlemen, I am not unaware of the sort of suspicions which in the minds
                            of men habituated to certain trains of reflection may operate with
                            regard to the intention of a man brought as I am into this place; the
                            suspicions that there may be something wrong in his character or
                            purposes, both with regard to what he has written and what he may be
                            about to say. But I am sure, gentlemen, I need not state to you the
                            obligation under which you have come, you who are sworn to be my
                            impartial judges, the obligation to strip your minds of all such
                            prepossessions, because they are directly contrary to that clearness, to
                            that fairness with which you should come to the questions this day to be
                            submitted to the soundness of your judgements and the purity of your
                            consciences. The balance of justice, gentlemen, ought most assuredly to
                            be even. That balance, on this occasion, exists in your minds. If you
                            come with the beam loaded at one end with everything unfavourable to me,
                            it is evident the other end must toss it on high. We talk of the pure
                            and white robes of justice—Gentlemen, it were desirable, that when men

                            according to a common but expressive figure of speech, a sheet of blank
                            paper—and that nothing should be written upon it but the evidence which
                            the judicial procedure holds up to view—the real evidence, that which is
                            genuine and solid, separated and sifted from that which is false and
                            adulterine. To shew, gentlemen, at the very outset, on what plain and

                        <p>Let us endeavour, gentlemen, to invent a general form of speech, to
                            conceive the tenor of a law which would involve my case: “Every
                                man who does so and so, shall be punished so and so.” Let us
                            now trace the consequences of this law. Are you aware gentlemen of what
                            you will do, but <sic>by</sic> lending yourselves to the setting up of
                            such a law? Gentlemen, if I were to tell to you, my judges, that it is
                            essentially your duty to come _apply_ to the discharge of your solemn
                            office, with minds free from prejudice against me, I should doubtless
                            appear to offer to you a very common, and unnecessary piece of advice.
                            But if we consider a little more closely all that is included under the
                            word prejudice, we shall find that it is a far more rare thing to come
                            to the administration of justice with minds free from prejudice, than is
                            vulgarly supposed. We are all abundantly ready to assert to the truth of
                            the general maxim; to say that we ought to weigh and judge exempt from
                            prejudice, and even to fancy that we are exempt, when if we were to take
                            a little pains with our minds, we should often [find] we had need to put
                            a strong guard upon ourselves. Not only, if we have any interest, either
                            of the pecuniary passion, or of pride, or rank, or promotion, or the
                            favour of the great, involved in the condemnation or acquittal, we may
                            be pretty sure that we are not altogether unprejudiced, but likewise if
                            our fears have been alarmed, or our hopes excited with regard to any
                            consequences real or imaginary involved in the decision, we may be sure
                            that we have much need to oppose some resistance to the influence of the
                            passion, and as it is necessary, in order to make a rod straight, which
                            has been bent in one direction, to bend it with proportional force in
                            the other, so it is necessary for the man whose mind is bent by his
                            passions in one direction, to bend it pretty strongly by his reason in
                            the other, to give it any chance of</p><pb/>

                        <p>being straight, upright and even, in its decisions. As we do not like to
                            estimate our own weaknesses strongly, most of us, too, make far too
                            little allowance for the force of our passions; and hence the frequency
                            of our mistakes and imprudencies both in private and in public life.
                            Will it be deemed indecent then, gentlemen, if I am somewhat urgent with
                            you on the present occasion to lean strongly to your reason, and to keep
                            a watchful eye upon yourselves on the side where passion or emotion
                            works—especially when I know the pains which have long been employed to
                            excite and keep alive alarms upon this subject; to make the free
                            exercise of the press be looked upon as dangerous, as tantamount to the
                            subversion of all law, order, and justice; calling up to every man’s
                            mind the hazard of character, the destruction of property and life, the
                            utter confusion of society, and the subversion of every thing which is
                            dear to us. I entertain the firmest confidence, gentlemen, of making out
                            to your satisfaction, of convincing you, if memory serve me, under the
                            embarrassment to which the newness of this situation exposes me, and I
                            can find words to explain to you the thoughts which have often been
                            deliberately weighed in my own mind, and [have] produced there the
                            deepest conviction. But should I be happy enough in this way to
                            accomplish what I desire, shall I venture to tell you, gentlemen, what
                            war after this I still dread? Gentlemen, it is, that even if you should
                            be convinced, you will not even then be exempt from the action of your
                            fears. There is something in the operation of fears, gentlemen, like the
                            action of the winds upon the sea. The rolling and tossing of the billows
                            does not immediately cease, upon the ceasing of the storm which caused
                            it. The agitation of the waters often lasts for a considerable time
                            longer. In like manner, it is natural to the mind, after it has been
                            agitated by any fear, to find itself still actuated by that fear, after
                            it is ever so perfectly convinced that the fear is altogether
                            groundless. How often does it happen, when a man has been awakened even
                            by a terrific dream, that he finds it difficult to compose himself again
                            to sleep? How rarely does it happen that a man who has been frightened
                            with stories of ghosts in his infancy can pass entirely free from
                            emotion a lonely churchyard in the dead hour of night, though ever so
                            much convinced of the non-existence of ghosts; and how many men are
                            there, perfectly convinced of their non-existence who would sooner mount
                            a breach than go into certain situations alone in the dark. I am,
                            therefore, afraid gentlemen, and beg you to consider how much reason I
                            have for my fear, that if as much as you are convinced there are no
                            ghosts and spectres in church yards, as much [as] I shall be able to
                            convince you, that there are no evil spirits in freedom of the press,
                            you will yet when brought into the church yard feel your fears; and that
                            the effects of them will fall upon my devoted head.</p>

                        of the CPB: Liberty of the Press I (81r-105v) has little, if any, material
                        later than 1812-13; whereas <emph>Liberty of the Press</emph> II (3r-19v)
                        has quotations from the debates of 1818-19, and a novel published in 1821.
                        Further, the hand of the last three paragraphs of § III betrays the
                        deterioration of Mill’s eyesight of the mid-1820s. This material clearly was
                        used for his <emph>Encyclopædia Britannica</emph> article “Liberty of the
                        Press,” which was published in July 1821 (see the clutch of quotations from
                        here and other sections to be found on p. 267 of the original edition). Mill
                        asked Macvey Napier for permission to write an article on “‘Liberty of the
                        Press,’ or ‘Libel Law’” in a letter of 3/1/1821, and in a letter of
                        10/7/1821 he was “hard at work upon the article … and for that purpose
                        suspended the printing of … Political Economy.”</p>
                    <p>Clearly this material should be read in conjunction with the collection of
                        scraps in <emph>CPB</emph> II <ref target="cpb2ch1">under the same title</ref>. The
                        virtual absence of scraps in <emph>CPB</emph> V reveals Mill’s concern for this
                        issue—nearly every bit had been collected and arranged by him, whereas other
                        topics (such as § I) did not quite engage his attention in the same way. As
                        well, the title list of sections from 89r to 105r of <emph>Liberty of the
                            Press I</emph>, as well as 3r to 9r of <emph>Liberty of the Press

                        theme.</p>
                    <p>In a very real sense, this material is but a subsection of the larger
                        Benthamite concern over the proper theory and practice of rewards and
                        punishments (as any reader of the <emph>Encyclopædia</emph> article with its
                        curious emphasis on undue or unmerited praise of public figures, laws, and
                        institutions will discern), but it may also link to the quite different
                        thrust of the need to free radical political and religious (or rather
                        anti-religious) advocacy from the shackles of the omnipresent threat of
                        prosecution for seditious libel by the reactionary Attorneys General of the
                        period. In this age the phrase ‘reactionary Attorneys General’ is, of
                        course, a pleonasm.</p>

                                of the liberty of the press, the same as the question whether the
                                subjects of government should be instructed in the proceedings of
                                government</emph>. The question of the liberty of the press,
                            Gentlemen, in the large survey of reason, resolves itself into a very
                            clear and simple one. It is this. Whether the people, the subjects of
                            any government ought to be instructed in the proceedings of their own
                            government. That gentlemen is the question. If that must be decided in
                            the affirmative, and if the decision is an universal one, admitting of
                            no exceptions, but what may be constituted by the special circumstances
                            of special occasions, then gentlemen must I receive from you a verdict
                            of acquittal, on every principle both of justice and expediency. See
                            gentlemen within what a narrow space the argument lies, and how close
                            and cogent its conclusion. The proposition with which we set out is,
                            that the people ought to receive information respecting their
                            government, and information not calculated to mislead. But for this
                            purpose, gentlemen, both sides must be heard: therefore the side which
                            blames, as well as the side which praises: the liberty of blame ought to
                            be as ample as the liberty of praise. But the liberty of praise is
                            without limit; therefore, so ought to be the liberty of blame.
                            Gentlemen, this is demonstrative, and unanswerable. If reason only were
                            concerned, not a word more would be necessary to be said. It is good for
                            mankind, that the subject should be truly informed respecting the
                            conduct of their governors, but this without unlimited power of blame,
                            they never can be. Can you gentlemen perceive a single flaw in this
                            chain of reasoning? It is short, and clear, and easily comprehended. If
                            there were any defect you would not fail to discern it. But you do not
                            discern any. Thus gentlemen, it ought to govern your resolves. The fear,
                            however, of the ghosts remains, after the existence of the ghosts is no
                            longer believed. <note>Last sentence added later.</note></p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the answer to Cato in Cicero’s oration for Muræna,
                            there are some good observations on the mischief of authority in matters
                            of judicature; of the weight of the accuser’s character passing for any
                            thing against a defendant in the scales of justice. (c. 28).
                                <note>Cicero, <emph>Pro Murena</emph>, c. 59, Loeb 261: “I do
                                    not like a prosecutor to come into court with overweening power,
                                    an excessive force, overwhelming influence or too much
                                    popularity. Let all these assets be used to deliver the
                                    innocent, protect the weak and help those in trouble; for the
                                    trial and destruction of fellow-citizens, let them be
                                    rejected.”</note></p>
                        <p>In the same oration, c. 29, is the following passage, which on occasion
                            might have its use. “Seeing, too, that I do not have to address
                                an ignorant crowd or some gathering of rustics, I shall be a little
                                more venturesome in discussing the liberal studies which are so
                                familiar and agreeable to us both.” [L]

                                well as private life, the only way to prevent being ridiculed or
                                censured, is to avoid all ridiculous or wicked measures. […] The
                                people never endeavour to ridicule those they love and esteem, nor
                                will they suffer them to be ridiculed: if any one attempts it the
                                ridicule returns upon the author; he makes himself only the object
                                of public hatred and contempt. The actions or behaviour of a private
                                person may pass unobserved, and consequently unapplauded,
                                uncensured; but the actions of those in high station can neither
                                pass without notice, nor without censure or applause; and therefore
                                an administration, without esteem, without authority

                                their power be never so arbitrary, will be ridiculed: the severest
                                edicts, the most terrible punishments cannot prevent it. If any man
                                therefore thinks he has been censured, if any man thinks he has been
                                ridiculed, […] let him examine his actions, he will find the cause,
                                let him alter his conduct, he will find a remedy. […] It is not
                                licentiousness, it is an useful liberty […] that some great men may
                                [there] meet with a just reproof, which none of their friends will
                                be free enough, or rather faithful enough to give them. Of this we
                                have a famous instance in the Roman history. The great Pompey, after
                                the many victories he had obtained and the great conquests he had
                                made, had certainly a good title to the esteem of the people of
                                Rome: yet that great man by some error in his conduct, became an
                                object of general dislike; and therefore in the representation of an
                                old play, when Diphilus, the actor, came to repeat these words,
                                    <emph>Nostra miseria tu es magnus</emph> [Because of our misery
                                you are great], the audience immediately applied them to Pompey, who
                                at that time was as well known by the name Magnus as by the name
                                Pompey, and were so highly pleased with the satire, that, as Cicero
                                says, they made him repeat the words a hundred times over. An
                                account of this was immediately sent to Pompey, who, instead of
                                resenting it as an injury, was so wise as to take it for a just
                                reproof; he examined his conduct, he altered his measures, he
                                regained by degrees the esteem of the people, and therefore neither
                                feared the wit nor felt the satire of the stage. This is an example
                                which ought to be followed by great men in all countries. Such
                                accidents will often happen in every free country, and many such
                                would probably have afterwards happened at Rome, if they had
                                continued to enjoy this liberty; but this sort of liberty on the
                                stage came soon after, I suppose, to be called licentiousness; for
                                we are told that Augustus, after having established his empire,
                                restored order in Rome, by restraining licentiousness. God forbid!
                                we should in this country have order restored, or licentiousness
                                restrained, at so dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to
                                Augustus.” Lord Chesterfield’s Speech on the Bill for

                                while abhorring those who revile you to your harm as inimical to the
                                state, you ought to commend those who admonish you for your good and
                                to esteem them as the best of your fellow citizens, and him most of
                                all, even among them, who is able to point out most vividly the
                                evils of your practices, and the disasters which result from them.
                                For such a man can soonest bring you to abhor what you should abhor
                                and to set your hearts on better things.” [G]

                        <p>Gentlemen, there is another cause of belief, which I must strongly put
                            you on your guard against, and that is imitation, or sympathy, or
                            contagion, or call it what you will. Gentlemen, it is a well ascertained
                            fact, that whenever we are not guarded by some effectual counteraction,
                            we are very apt to believe any thing, merely because other people
                            believe it. Our nature, gentlemen, is so constituted, that almost every
                            thing which our fellow creature does, we have a tendency to do after
                            him. To instance in the most vulgar and familiar actions—if our
                            neighbour yawns, we have a tendency to yawn after him—if our play fellow
                            squints, we are apt to acquire the disagreeable habit of squinting.
                            This, gentlemen, is the principle which renders bad company so
                            corruptive, and good company so improving to the young. Gentlemen,
                            nothing about us is more subject to this fatal tendency than our belief.
                            The belief of another man merely because it is his belief, and without a
                            thought of any other reason, is often the cause of our belief. The
                            stronger the expression of his belief, the more apt we are to be
                            infected. When a man comes forward, and with countenance and tone and
                            gesture exhibits all the marks of a vehement belief, it is but rarely we
                            resist the contagion. This happens when the man has no peculiar dignity
                            or authority. But when it also occurs, that he is a person to whom we
                            look with reverence, that he is vested with those circumstances of power
                            and authority which captivate and awe the imagination, when he is a
                            person to whom wisdom and knowledge is ascribed, whom we think it safe
                            to follow, and unsafe to relinquish, then gentlemen our belief is for
                            the most part as surely captivated and enthralled by the bold and
                            imposing declaration of his belief as if he had a physical power over
                            our instruments of thought. Gentlemen, it much concerns me to put you on
                            your guard against this, what shall I call it, this imitative belief,
                            which passes from one man to another as the plague does, by contagion.
                            You cannot need any words to persuade you gentlemen that this is not the
                            best sort of belief. It is a sort of an animal propensity much more than
                            a rational act; and is always the most operative upon the weakest
                            and</p><pb/>

                        <p>most irrational minds. And on all occasions when any better foundation of
                            belief is attainable, it is not only weak, but culpable to be governed
                            by it. On all occasions when that belief is to operate materially,
                            heavily, tremendously upon the feelings of a fellow creature, it is not
                            weak and culpable only—far from it—on that occasion to borrow
                            unnecessarily any man’s belief is gentlemen one of the most heinous
                            offences of which one human being can be guilty towards another. When
                            therefore gentlemen you shall hear and see produced before you (as I
                            have no doubt that you will hear and see) the strongest outward
                            expressions that can be conveyed to your eyes and ears, in words, in
                            tones, in features, and gestures, of the strongest belief in my having
                            done something to an extraordinary degree mischievous, let not any other
                            man’s belief be the cause of your belief; for this would only be to do
                            what the meanest and weakest of mankind would do. And gentlemen, believe
                            me, it will require a considerable effort from you to prevent that
                            production of belief against which I warn you, for it is a propensity of
                            our common nature very strong; and if you are not men of stronger heads
                            and finer hearts, if you are not men of better intellects and higher
                            virtue than is found in many men, you will be unequal to the
                            struggle—you will not make the distinctions which ought to be made—you
                            will not resist the tide—you will not ask yourself what is this the man
                            presents to me—is it reasons, cries, mere words? Is it facts or mere
                            declarations of his own opinion and belief? Let him cry, scandalous,
                            malicious, mischievous, as long as he pleases—this expresses his
                            opinion, but it does nothing more. Well, is it necessary that his
                            belief, should be the creator of mine, though he cannot shew me a reason
                            for it? Could he have shewn me a reason he would have done it. If you
                            only can, gentlemen, and will explore what you will hear said against me
                            in this manner, I am sure I know what will be your conclusion. For
                            gentlemen I well know what will be produced against me. I well know that
                            you will not hear a single argument which is not begging of the
                            question, a mere assertion more or less disguised, of the thing to be
                            proved. Gentlemen, I here, in the face of this court defy them to
                            produce any thing else against; and undertake gentlemen, and before you
                            solemnly pledge myself to demonstrate to the world that not another
                            thing has been produced against me.</p>

                        <p>I have endeavoured to prove to you, gentlemen, that I am not guilty, that
                            I merit praise rather than blame, not to speak of punishment. But I will
                            suppose that I have not been successful. I will suppose, not only that I
                            have not convinced you of the innocuousness of my writing, but that it
                            really is not innocent. The next inquiry is, gentlemen, and [a] no less
                            important one, what punishment does it deserve? Supposing that it does
                            deserve punishment, it does not follow that any punishment that may be
                            applied to it will be just. I am well aware, gentlemen, that now is not
                            the time, according to the doctrine of the court, for estimating the due
                            measure of punishment. Neither do I intend in the smallest degree to
                            trespass upon that doctrine. But I well know likewise, gentlemen, that
                            the statute has made you, you gentlemen of the jury, <hi
                                rend="underline">judge</hi> of the law—I well know that the
                            punishment is the main part of the law, and that you gentlemen do not
                            judge of the law, [you] renounce a conspicuous part of your duty, if you
                            pronounce a verdict without carrying in your judgement a sound and
                            serious reflection on the probable measure of punishment, the
                            apportioning of which is, in this case, above all others unhappily taken
                            out of your hands. For these reasons gentlemen, I am entitled, not
                            indeed to enter into the particulars of this particular case, and to
                            shew what those particulars demand of peculiar in the punishment adapted
                            to it. That undoubtedly is proper on another occasion. But I am
                            entitled, gentlemen, to present to your recollection what is general in
                            the class of punishments inflicted upon this class of cases, and to hold
                            up to your minds what in that class of inflictions, ought to be present
                            to your minds to enable you to conclude agreeably to justice in the case
                            now before you. Surely, gentlemen, all offences ought not to be subject
                            to the same punishments. Surely one of the most essential and
                            indispensable concerns of justice is to proportion the coercion to the
                            offence. Is it denied gentlemen that it is agreeable to law and justice,
                            that your resolutions should be absolutely governed, in opposition to
                            proud and established guilt, entirely by the consideration of the
                            punishment to which your verdict would give birth? Surely, gentlemen, it
                            will not be denied that this is agreeable to justice. Display that.
                            Surely the gentlemen of this court will know that it is law. In how many
                            cases, when stolen property is proved to be worth many pounds, are the
                            jury instructed to call it worth less than 40 shillings solely to evade
                            a severe punishment? Work this. Now gentlemen</p><pb/>

                            inflicted upon me, you do not judge of the law by giving me up to it—you

                            Hystaspes because the Christians used them to confirm their dogmas.
                            ‘These are the Demons,’ says he, ‘who have suggested a similar law to
                            keep humanity in its chains and to prevent it from knowing the truth.’ …
                            It is necessary,” adds Beausobre, “to refute books which contain
                                lies and errors, and not to throw them on the fire.” [F] He
                            remarks however that though the Christians felt the injustice of this
                            proceeding against themselves, they failed not to employ it, as soon as
                            the power came into their own hands. Beausobre says, “It is not
                                easy to describe as just the zeal of these early bishops of whom the
                                first ones induced the Christian Emperors to consign to the fire the
                                books of the heretics and to bestow the penalty of death against
                                those who read them, or those who kept them in their
                                houses.” [F] Beausobre, <emph>Hist. de Manich</emph>., Disc.

                                on to remark on p. 219 that “there are in fact books worthy
                                    of being burnt; those which corrupt morals or which strike at
                                    the foundations of religion and society. As for other books one
                                    ought to be content to keep them hidden from the people without
                                    entirely suppressing them; just as one is careful to hide
                                    poisons from those who are not sufficiently cautious so that one
                                    may use them to some purpose.” J.S. Mill in his
                                    <emph>Autobiography</emph> refers to his father’s expressing
                                    “surprise, that no one revived {Manichæism} in our own

                            “false-as-hell” speech, on the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> March 1813, on Whitbread’s complaint
                            on the form and import which had been given to Mrs. Lisle’s evidence,
                            said, “One of the most alarming symptoms, my lords, of the age in
                                which we live, is the brutal indifference with which slander is cast
                                on high characters.” If by casting slander, the lord meant
                            accurate scrutiny, and unreserved publication, it is a brutality which I
                            hope to see continue and increase. These <del>nobles</del> men, great by
                            place, or great by income, think the world is not fit to live in,
                            because it insists a little more than formerly upon their good conduct;
                            and upon telling them when it thinks their conduct not such as it ought
                            to be. It was fine times for “<hi rend="underline">the highest
                                    characters</hi>,” when no one dared to open his lips
                            except in their praise, whether their conduct was good or bad. Still
                            better times when the minds of men, from weakness and ignorance were so
                            besotted, as to conceive every thing, however detestable, which their
                            rulers did, to be excellent. A state of mind, the most detestable and
                            humiliating of all others, in which superstition toward the pageants of
                            power confounded the sense of right and wrong, is the state the loss of
                            which your Ellenboroughs deplore. Then the highest characters might be
                            as vicious characters as they chose. Laying their characters perfectly
                            open to canvass, makes them stand upon their good behaviour. Putting
                            them upon that is detestable. The “brutal indifference” makes them
                            attend to goodness of conduct—makes them foresee that no respect is
                            secured for them without it. No respect! without good conduct, to the
                            highest characters: what a symptom of the age? Respect them, however bad
                            their conduct may be; that is the way to</p><pb/>

                                depended more of the property and interests of the people than on
                                those of any other man in the country.” The cure of a
                            physician’s patients depends upon the reality of his skill, fidelity,
                            and care, not upon his character for it. When a quack happens to get
                            this reputation, his patients are not the better for it. With regard to
                            that highest character the lord chief justice, if he happens to have the
                            character only and not the reality of the good qualities which he
                            enumerates, it will not fare much better with the people for having the
                            character. One would rather, I presume to think, if you had one’s
                            choice, have the reality without the character, than the character

                        <p>Dryden says, there are two sorts of vituperative discourses, whether
                            grave or satyrical, whether in prose or in verse; one, such as the
                            epodes of Horace, where he lashed Canidia, or a Cassius Severus; the
                            other, such as satires and epistles, where his object is “to
                                correct the vices and follies of his time, and to give the rules of
                                a happy and virtuous life.” The latter species of
                            vituperative discourse he represents as always laudable. Even the
                            former, which he distinguishes by the term lampoon, he represents as on
                            two occasions good and proper. “There are only two reasons for which we may
                                be permitted to write lampoons; and I will not promise that they can
                                always justify us.—The first is—revenge, when we have been affronted

                                notoriously abused, and can make ourselves no other
                                reparation.” He then goes on at some length to shew that he
                            himself had always used this license very sparingly, and next proceeds,
                                “Any thing, though never so little, which a man speaks of
                                himself, in my opinion, is still too much; and therefore I will wave
                                this subject, and proceed to give the second reason which may
                                justify a poet, when he writes against a particular person; and that
                                is, when he is become a public nuisance. All those whom Horace in
                                his satires, and Persius and Juvenal have mentioned in theirs, with
                                a brand of infamy, are wholly such. It is an action of virtue to
                                make examples of vicious men. They may, and ought to be upbraided
                                with their crimes and follies: both for their own amendment, if they
                                are not yet incorrigible, and for the terror of others, to hinder
                                them from falling into those enormities, which they see are so
                                severely punished in the persons of others. The first reason was
                                only an excuse for revenge; but this second is absolutely of a
                                poet’s office to perform.” Dryden, Origin and Progress of

                                    atrocious act of violence, exposes the monarchy so much to the

                                    attempted in any civilized government. But confinement, though a
                                    less striking, is no less severe a punishment; nor is there any
                                    spirit, so erect and independent, as not to be broken by the
                                    long continuance of the silent and inglorious sufferings of a
                                    jail. The power of imprisonment, therefore, being the most

                                shew any advantage it can produce, by any species of acts, but those
                                which they punish</emph>. But, my lord, let us come to the very
                            essence and principle of this case. The liberty of the press my
                            antagonists allow, is valuable. Well; what is it valuable for? I rest
                            upon them [to show] a single thing for which it is of any value, but to
                            arraign a bad minister, or a bad measure; or of what produces bad
                            ministers and measures, [or] bad institutions? Gentlemen, it is both the
                            interest and the duty of every member of the community to endeavour to
                            procure the removal of every man in a station of public trust, whom he
                            thinks unequal to its duties.</p><pb/>

                            be disallowed in the case of the good. You cannot enjoy this important

                            with atheism, and when the severest punishment was promised him against
                            his malignant defamer, declared, “that he should think himself

                                    show the source of your slanders. I pity you, Fathers, for
                                    resorting to such remedies. Your insults will not clear up our
                                    differences and your various threats will not stop me defending
                                    myself. You think you have power and impunity on your side, but
                                    I think I have truth and innocence on mine. It is a long strange
                                    war when violence tries to suppress truth. All the efforts of
                                    violence cannot weaken truth, and only serve to reinforce it.
                                    All the enlightenment of truth can do nothing to halt violence
                                    and only exasperates it more. When power fights power, the
                                    greater destroys the less: when argument is set against
                                    argument, those which are true and convincing confound and
                                    disperse those which are only vanity and lies; but violence and
                                    truth have no power over each other. Let no one claim, however,
                                    that they are equal, for there is the enormous difference that
                                    the course of violence is limited by the decree of God, who
                                    applies its effects to the glory of the truth it attacks,
                                    whereas truth exists eternally and finally triumphs over its
                                    enemies, because it is eternal and mighty as God
                                    himself.”</note></p>

                                (different tr.) 131-3: “O my child, I fear you cannot be
                                    long-lived; and that some creature of the great ones will strike
                                    you with the cold of death. What? when Lucilius had the courage
                                    to be the first in composing verses after this manner, and to
                                    pull off that mask, by means of which each man strutted in
                                    public view with a fair outside, though foul within; was Lælius,
                                    and he who derived a well deserved title from the destruction of
                                    Carthage, offended at his wit, or were they hurt at Metellus
                                    being lashed, or Lupus covered over with his lampoons? But he
                                    took to task the heads of the people, and the people themselves,
                                    class by class; in short, he spared none but virtue and her
                                    friends. Yet, when the valorous Scipio, and the mild
                                    philosophical Lælius, had withdrawn themselves from the crowd
                                    and the public scene, they used to divert themselves with him,
                                    and joke in a free manner.” Smart’s tr. is used as it
                                better emphasizes the point Mill makes.</note></p>

                            The maxim might be a little farther generalized. To be truly an

                                    and faction, and calculated for extending a corrupt influence in

                        <p>Gentlemen, that in arguing before you the grounds upon which your
                            decision in this question ought to be founded, I am entitled to take a
                            pretty extensive range, meaning by that, gentlemen, not a title to wear
                            you out with a multitude of words, that I shall endeavour to avoid, but
                            a title to draw the ideas which I think necessary for the satisfaction
                            of your consciences from a field of considerable extent, and a bottom of
                            considerable depth; I can prove by decisive considerations.—The Attorney
                            General, in the case of the Trial of Peltier, said, “On this
                                occasion, my duty, as well as my inclination, will not only lead me,
                                but confine me, to adhere strictly […] to the dry and dull
                                examination of the intention, of the meaning, and of the tendency,
                                of the libel now under prosecution; and of the question of law, as
                                connected with the prosecution itself, viz., whether the law of this
                                country, from what we know of it, by the proceedings which have
                                already taken place in this very court, by what we know of it from
                                reason and principle, from the principles of common sense, of
                                wisdom, and policy, can possibly either defend as innocent, or
                                consider as indifferent, a publication such as that which is the
                                subject of the present prosecution.” So far, gentlemen, the
                            Attorney General. We have never heard, gentlemen, that the ground thus
                            meted out by the Attorney General is liable to any objection. One thing
                            we know beyond contradiction, gentlemen, that it received the highest
                            sanction which it could receive, that of the court before which it was
                            delivered. Observe now the words of this elevated lawyer. “The question
                            of law,” he says, “as connected with this prosecution,” is what? It is
                            the question, he says, whether a publication such as that before [you],
                            should be considered innocent or guilty. And what are the sources, from
                            which, he says, that this legal question is to be resolved? He mentions
                            five, gentlemen; the practice of the court, secondly reason and
                            principle, thirdly the principles of common sense, fourthly the
                            principles of wisdom, and lastly the principles of policy. Now, then,
                            gentlemen, in my endeavour to shew to you, what the principles of that
                            law which you have to administer, recommend to you to perform on the
                            present occasion, it is open for me to draw the ideas which I may think
                            necessary for the elucidation of the subject from all these sources.
                            First the practice of the court. That it is a proper source, few lawyers
                            will deny. But the practice of the court, gentlemen, is of two
                            sorts—there is its negative practice, as well as its positive, and an
                            adequate idea can by no means be attained without a competent knowledge
                            of the other etc. Go on with the commentary on all five sources.

                        <p>The Attorney General in Peltier’s trial said, “This is not the

                                an historical narration of events, […] when these events may or may
                                not be accompanied with just reflections on the conduct and
                                character of the persons who may have been the actors in the
                                different scenes. This is not a prosecution, meaning to bring to
                                punishment the author, of a narration of historical truth, which
                                should not be complained of when written in the spirit of history,
                                though it may give pain to others—if it be written with an honest
                                zeal, even though with some degree of freedom approaching to
                                licentiousness.” p. 43. “Though the province of the
                                historian be the detail of facts, yet if he introduced the fair
                                discussion of the politician, or of the philosopher, on the facts
                                and events he detailed, even this, unquestionably, published fairly,

                                    way. I wish Mr. Woolston no harm; I only wish him a sincere

                                    about by solid reasons and arguments, without pains or
                                    penalties. … I agree exactly with … Tertullian … that the new
                                    law does ‘not defend itself by the law of the

                                    for writing at all against the Christian religion; which appears
                                    to me to be a noble declaration. If the governors of the church
                                    and civil magistrates had all along had acted up to this
                                    principle, I think, the Christian religion had been before now
                                    well-nigh universal.” In his letter to Lardner of

                                    learning, may reasonably incline him to pay to guides set over
                                    him, whom he believes to be faithful and skilful; and, lastly,
                                    all terms of communion, which are not necessary articles of

                        <p>The question is—whether the people should have the power of chusing
                            opinions for themselves, or some other body should have the power of
                            chusing for them. If any other body, it must of course be the
                            magistrate; because if not, the chuser will supplant. But it is evident
                            that the magistrate of all conceivable persons is the last who ought to
                            be intrusted with this power, because he has an overruling _overbearing_
                            interest to chuse wrong. He has an interest to chuse all such opinions
                            as are most subservient to the increase of his own power, till it is
                            absolutely without limits; that is, all those opinions [which] lead most
                            effectually to, and most irrevocably maintain, the brutification of

                                then they soon wrote the libellers out of the pit; and during that

                                    “Gentlemen, you are here to find the defendant guilty, or
                                    to absolve him, having respect to the particular passage that is
                                    taken out of the pamphlet. … What … you must be convinced of in
                                    order to find the defendant guilty [is]—the <emph>quo
                                        animo</emph> with which this publication was made by the
                                    party … whether it was published with the motive or not is the
                                    question of the present minute for you to decide. … I should
                                    examine the pamphlet: and I should see, with every fair leaning
                                    to the side of lenity and compassion, whether I thought the
                                    party was guilty or not. … {T} his is to be done in mercy … but
                                    … not … that blind mercy which obliterates the

                                the different writings which appeared under the arbitrary reign of

                                the last century to a degree that excites horror. The case is the
                                same in Italy, where however the press has at all times been
                                subjected to the most galling restrictions. Ignorance in the bulk of
                                the people, and the most lawless independence in men of superior

                        <p>“It is worthy of remark, in justice to Johnson’s political
                                character, which has been misrepresented as abjectly submissive to
                                power, that his ‘Observations on the present state of affairs’ glow
                                with as animated a spirit of constitutional liberty as can be found
                                any where. Thus he begins: ‘The time is now come, in which every
                                Englishman expects to be informed of the national affairs, and in
                                which he has a right to have that expectation gratified. For
                                whatever may be urged by ministers, or those whom vanity or interest
                                make the followers of ministers, concerning the necessity for
                                confidence in our governors, and the presumption of prying with
                                profane eyes into the recesses of policy, it is evident, that this
                                reverence can be claimed only by counsels yet unexecuted, and
                                projects suspended in deliberation. But when a design has ended in
                                miscarriage or success, when every eye and every ear is witness to
                                general discontent, or general satisfaction, it is then a proper
                                time to disentangle confusion, and illustrate obscurity, to shew by
                                what causes every event was produced, and in what effects it is
                                likely to terminate: to lay down with distinct particularity what
                                rumour always huddles in general exclamations, or perplexes by
                                undigested narratives; to shew whence happiness or calamity is
                                derived, and whence it may be expected; and honestly to lay before
                                the people what inquiry can gather of the past, and conjecture can
                                estimate of the future.’ Here we have it assumed as an
                                incontrovertible principle, that in this country the <hi

                        <p>“The mischief of bad books is only to be corrected by good ones,
                                the bad consequences of knowledge are only avoided by rendering
                                knowledge more complete. There are two roads to every thing: to
                                retrench that which is dangerous, or to inspire strength to resist
                                it. The latter is the only method that suits the times in which we
                                live: innocence cannot now have ignorance for its companion, that
                                can only cause mischief. So many words have been spoken, so many
                                sophisms repeated, that it is necessary to know much, in order to
                                judge rightly; and the times have passed in which men confined their
                                ideas to the patrimony of their fathers. We must think then, not in
                                what manner to repel the introduction of knowledge, but how to
                                render it complete, so that it may not produce false colours by the
                                interruption of its beams. A government must not aspire to deprive a
                                great nation of the knowledge of the spirit which governs the age;
                                this spirit contains the elements of strength and of greatness,
                                which may be employed with success, when men are not afraid to
                                address every question boldly; then they will find in eternal truths
                                resources against transitory errors, and in liberty itself the
                                support of order, and the strength of government.” [F] Mad.

                                suffer the book to be publicly sold. For when I have detected the

                                    “There are two conditions under which we might
                                    philosophize. Either we are permitted to state openly what we
                                    think is true or false, or else we are permitted to defend only
                                    what others think is true. No one will deny that in the former
                                    case we philosophize in freedom and in the latter case we have
                                    no freedom. Therefore, the freedom to philosophize is the
                                    permission to state publicly our own opinion on philosophical
                                    issues. … Philosophical servitude is the compulsion to defend
                                    the philosophical opinions of others as true, even though we do
                                    not think they are true.”</note></p>

                        <p>“Any person […] who is zealous for promoting the interest of his
                                country must conquer all that tenderness and delicacy which may make
                                him afraid of being spoken ill of; or his endeavours will often
                                produce no less uneasiness to himself, than benefit to the public.
                                Among a people who indulge themselves in the utmost freedom of
                                thought and speech, a man must either be insignificant, or able to
                                bear an undeserved reproach. A true patriot may comfort himself
                                under the attacks of falsehood and obloquy, from several motives and
                                reflections. … A statesman, who is possessed of real merit, should
                                look upon his political censorers with the same neglect, that a good
                                writer regards his critics; who are generally a race of men that are
                                not able to discover the beauties of a work they examine, and deny
                                that approbation to others which they never met with themselves. …
                                They should likewise consider, that not only envy, but vanity, has a
                                share in the detraction of their adversaries. Such aspersions,
                                therefore, do them honour, at the same time that they are intended
                                to lessen their reputation. … A virtuous man, therefore, who lays
                                out his endeavours for the good of his Country, should never be
                                troubled at the reports which are made of him, so long as he is
                                conscious of his own integrity. He should rather be pleased to find
                                people descanting upon his actions, because when they are thoroughly
                                canvassed and examined, they are sure in the end to turn to his
                                honour and advantage. The reasonable and unprejudiced part of
                                mankind will be of his side, and rejoice to see their common
                                interest lodged in such honest hands. A strict examination of a
                                great man’s character, is like the trial of a suspected chastity,
                                which was made among the Jews by the waters of jealousy. Moses
                                assures us, that the criminal burst upon the drinking of them; but
                                if she was accused wrongfully, the rabbins tell us, they heightened
                                her charms; and made her much more amiable than before. So that they
                                destroyed the guilty, but beautified the innocent.” Addison,

                        <p>“But you demand, What good statesmen would they be, who should
                                ideate or fancy such a commonwealth, as these men have framed to
                                themselves a church? Truly, if this be all the fault they have, that
                                they say, Every man is to use his own judgement in the choice of his
                                religion, and not to believe this or that sense of scripture, upon
                                the bare authority of any learned man or men, when he conceives he
                                has reasons to the contrary, which are of more weight than their

                                approbation of them; no, nor to conceal their judgement of them, if

                                to society, and of the evidence which belongs to it. That order is
                                either perfectly and clearly known, or it is not. In the first case,
                                its evidence and simplicity render the formation of heresies on the

                                the ruins of those which are opposed to it; it is further certain,
                                that every opinion which is not founded upon evidence will be
                                contradicted, until it is either destroyed, or recognized on
                                evidence for a truth, in which case it ceases to be a bare opinion,
                                and becomes an evident principle. And thus, in the pursuit of
                                truths, capable of being established on evidence, the conflict of
                                opinions leads, of necessity, to evidence, because it is by evidence
                                alone it is capable of being terminated.” [F]

                        <p>After a few sentences he adds, “So absolutely necessary is it to
                                leave to the whole body of society the greatest possible freedom of
                                examination and contradiction; so absolutely necessary is it to
                                abandon evidence to its own strength, that there is no other power
                                which can supply its place; physical power, of what magnitude
                                soever, can command actions alone, never opinions. The experience of
                                every day affords to this truth the evidence of the senses. So
                                little have our physical powers any influence over our opinions,
                                that our opinions, on the contrary, exercise an uncontrollable
                                dominion over our physical powers. Our physical powers are put in
                                motion, and guided by our opinions alone. The common or social
                                force, called the <emph>public force</emph>, is formed by the union
                                of the physical powers of many individuals. This supposes,
                                necessarily and invariably, a correspondent union of wills; and this
                                can never exist but in consequence of an union of opinions, good or
                                bad. It is, therefore, to reverse the order of things, and take the
                                effect for the cause; to desire to give the public force a power
                                over opinion, while it is from the union of opinions that public
                                force holds its own existence; and while, in consequence, it can
                                have no stability but in proportion to that which reigns in the
                                opinion on which it is founded; that is to say, in proportion as
                                have opinions, stript of evidence, are replaced by opinions fixed
                                and invariable, because founded upon evidence which cannot
                                deceive.” [F] <emph>Ib</emph>., p. 93, 94.

                        <p>The eleventh chapter is not less important, shewing—“that it is
                                not enough that positive laws be exactly conformable to the laws,
                                both natural and essential, of society. This first condition, which
                                    <hi rend="underline">requires the assurance that they [the laws]
                                    are constantly subjected to the natural laws</hi>, this being
                                done, it requires a second, which is, as we have seen, that this
                                conformity of laws be known in a manner that no one can doubt of
                                it.” [F] <emph>Ib</emph>., 131 [c. 11].</p>
                        <p>For submission to the laws, implicit submission, two things are
                            requisite, and without them there can be no steady submission—the first
                            is, that the laws conform exactly to the principle of utility—the second
                            is, that the evidence of this conformity be established in the minds of
                            those who are to obey. For this establishment, again, two things are
                            requisite—education—and unlimited freedom of discussion.

                                    to this sad pass could say for himself? Or if he spoke the

                            Lords on the passing of the bill for restricting the liberty of the
                            press in December 1819, and printed in the <emph>Times</emph> newspaper
                            13th [<emph>sic</emph> 8th] Dec. 1819, points out very strongly, pretty
                            strongly at least, the importance of defining a libel, and the mischief
                            that may be done, by the annexing of great penalties to an undefined
                            transgression. This in conformity with the doctrine taught by Mr. Mill
                            in the <emph>Edin. Rev</emph>., and afterwards contradicted in the same

                        <p>Because the offence of publishing a libel is more than any other that is
                            known to our law, undefined and uncertain. Publications which at one
                            time may be considered innocent and even laudable, may at another,
                            according to circumstances, and the different views of public accusers,
                            of Judges and of Juries, be thought deserving of punishment; and thus
                            the author and publisher of any writing dictated by the purest
                            intentions, on a matter of public interest, without any example to warn,
                            any definition to instruct, or any authority to guide him, may expose
                            himself to the penalty of being “banished from the United Kingdom
                                and all other parts of his Majesty’s dominions, for such term as the
                                Court in which such conviction shall take place shall order, or be
                                transported to such place as shall be appointed by his Majesty for

                                years.”</p>
                        <p>Because the fear of being subjected to the punishment of a common felon,
                            thus suspended over the head of any person who may have been once
                            convicted of publishing a libel, to which mere inadvertence may subject
                            him, and against which no degree of caution can afford him complete
                            security, must necessarily deter him from the fearless exercise of the
                            right, which has hitherto been the proud prerogative of Englishmen, of
                            freely discussing public measures, and endeavouring to warn his
                            countrymen against the dangerous encroachments of power.</p>
                        <p>Because this Bill, therefore, so inconsistent with the policy of our law,

                            subversive, in one of their main defences, of the rights and liberties

                        <p><emph>Definition of</emph> Libel. Sir James Mackintosh, in the debate
                            (Dec. 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 1819) on the press-gagging bill, said
                            that a seditious libel could not be defined—that it was puerile vanity
                            to attempt to define it—that the slightest knowledge of language and of
                            human nature shewed the absurdity—that language at one place had one
                            meaning, at a few miles distance another meaning. The first of the
                            properties of this effusion—is its disgusting arrogance—he is entitled
                            by his authority to settle what is definable, what not, and to determine
                            the epithets which belong to opponents. The next is—the poverty and
                            shallowness of the ideas. Sir James says, that seditious libel cannot be
                            defined—and the reason is, that the matter of fact must be individually
                            determined in each individual instance. Sir James might, by this time,
                            have learned to distinguish between the matter of fact, and the matter
                            of law. The meaning and tendency of the words, is in all cases of libel,
                            the question of <hi rend="underline">fact</hi>, not of law. It is the
                            business of the law to have determined beforehand, what and what
                            tendencies are to be treated as crimes. What <hi rend="underline"
                                >is</hi> the tendency, is matter of fact; what tendency is, or is
                            not criminal, is alone matter of law. If Sir James had cultivated reason
                            as much as rhetoric, he would have seen what tendency on this occasion
                            means. Words addressed to other men can have an evil tendency only by
                            inducing them to do something, to do something criminal. Sedition means
                            something done against the government. Now surely every act which a man
                            can commit against the government may be defined. Every species of act
                            by which the government may be impeded in performing —or rendered less
                            fit to perform, the services of government, may be defined, and surely
                            no other ought to be treated as criminal. This is a definition which
                            includes all offences against government—and according to this
                            definition, all those bills and statutes, promoting despotism, are acts
                            of sedition. <del>One of</del> The first service which government has to
                            perform is to secure to the people all the good which can be secured to
                            them—all the property—all the power—all the pleasure which they can
                            possibly have. If the writing in question has a tendency to bring the
                            government into this state, whatever the alteration which may be
                            urged—is not of a seditious tendency—according to the only rational
                            definition. And this is the reason, the conspiracy will not define—this
                            is the reason the whig, as well as the tory section of the conspiracy,
                            use all their endeavours to clamour down definition. The words of
                            Mackintosh, as reported in the <emph>Morn. Chron</emph>. are these:
                                “He maintained that seditious libel was undefinable, and it
                                would be a puerile pedantry in any man to attempt to define it.
                                Words held to be innocent at one time, and in a particular place,
                                were considered criminal a few miles off, and in a few hours after.
                                Any man who should attempt to define such a law, would betray at
                                once a want of knowledge of human nature, and an unskilfulness in
                                legislation. On a trial of libel the jury were the fit tribunal to
                                decide whether the accusation was or was not a just one.”
                            What a singular confounding of matter of law and matter of fact!

                        <p><emph>Definition of</emph> Libel. The conspiracy has a good reason for
                            saying that seditious libel cannot be defined: they dare not include in
                            a definition all that the support of the conspiracy requires to be
                            included. If they were to make a definition which included all which
                            they wish included, common feeling would be shocked; neither they, nor
                            other men would bear to look at it.—The indecency of their conflicting
                            pretences, however, is <del>truly</del> gross. They say libel cannot be
                            defined; yet they say that twelve unlettered men can in each individual
                            instance tell what it is, and what it is not. But how can any man tell
                            what is, or is not included in a general rule, if he knows not what the
                            rule is? <emph>Restrictions of the Press</emph> are all so many acts of
                            oppression against the people. They restrain all declarations even of
                            unfavourable truth with regard to the conspiracy. They give full
                            indulgence, and there is plenty of encouragement, to the propagation of
                            all manner of unfavourable lies against the people. Every thing is done
                            to excite a general belief that all odious and mischievous qualities
                            belong to the people. The people never have any inclination to what is
                            good—always have an inclination to all that is evil. They can never be
                            taught understanding—and if they could, they would only do mischief with
                            it.—The conspiracy have thus all that is necessary for their purpose.
                            Give a dog a bad name, and hang him. So they try with the people. The
                            aristocracy are fostered, pampered with a bad opinion of the people.
                            Their feeling towards them is a mixture of contempt, hatred, and fear.
                            To quiet this latter feeling, they are incited to seek all sorts of
                            methods for holding them fast in chains; and the other two passions keep
                            them free from all restraints of humanity in the use of any cruelties as
                            a means to their end.</p>
                        <p><emph>Intention</emph>. Gentlemen of the Jury—the information, or writ of
                            accusation includes malignity of intention in the offence. By so doing
                            gentlemen, it makes malignity of intention one of the qualities
                            necessary to constitute the offence, and without which the act is not an
                            offence. Gentlemen either the law makes it part of what constitutes the
                            offence, and thus the insertion of it here is useful—or if it does
                            not—and the act is an offence neither less nor more, with, or without
                            intention, then the law is guilty of more abuse, which cannot be
                            supposed. And it is reasonable and proper, gentlemen, that intention
                            should be held necessary to constitute the act an offence. Why, because,
                            if I did the act without evil intention—punishment is not necessary to
                            prevent me from repeating it—instruct me, and that is enough. <note>The

                                    target="cpb1ch3scrap16r">16r</ref> above</note>, said that
                            Treasonable Libel could not be defined; and he went on to brand with
                            infamy all who might be of a different opinion on this subject from
                            himself. He was also incautious enough to proceed to the giving of
                            reasons, in defence of his opinion. He said, that words which had one
                            meaning in this place, today, might have a different meaning, in another
                            place, or another day: <del>exposing a woeful confusion of ideas</del>
                            confounding not only a question of judicature with a question of
                            legislation, but the question of fact with the question of law. The
                            question of Legislation is, What is that meaning and tendency in words
                            which shall be considered as an offence? And the business of the
                            legislature is to point out and circumscribe that meaning and tendency
                            by a definition. In every case of words actually used, there are two
                            questions of judicature; the first, What is their precise meaning and
                            tendency? That is the question of fact: the second, Is this a meaning
                            and tendency included in the definition of the legislature? The ancient
                            Rhetoricians justly said that the <emph>status questionis</emph> [state
                            of the question] admitted of three possible varieties, <emph>An

                            is?] Both of this [<emph>sic</emph> these] are obviously question of
                            fact. And <emph>Quid sit</emph>? [What it is?] the answer to which
                            question is always properly rendered by the generical name, or its
                            definition: i.e., in a judicial question, of offence or not offence,
                            declaring under what law it is or is not included.</p>

                            libels, of course, is to be licentious: to publish the worst of libels,
                            namely the true ones, is to be in the greatest degree licentious.</p>

                            enemies of the press will speak clearly. They content themselves with
                            vague imputations. They pronounce, again, and again, that the press does
                            mischief; mischief of all kinds, mischief in boundless quantity. People,
                            who do not articulate, when they speak accusations, are to be held
                                <del>for consciously</del> as speaking what they do not believe.
                            They are self-convicted defamers. If they who speak against the people
                            would speak intelligibly, they must say that the press does mischief, by
                            some specific acts. Why decline to name the acts? Why so timorous on
                            their part? What danger do they anticipate from telling us fairly what
                            they would have the press prevented from doing? The vague imputations
                            seem distinguishable into three sorts: 1. Offences, by speaking evil of
                            the political institutions, and of men in authority: 2. Of speaking
                            about religion differently from the men in authority: 3. Of exposing
                            men’s private character and affairs: 4. Of inculcating immorality. —</p>

                            yes.—Well!—The greatest offence the press can commit against those
                            institutions and men, is to speak the truth of them.—It does mischief by
                            speaking evil of them, whether true, or false: because speaking evil of
                            them will make the people wish to change them.—Will the people ever wish
                            to change any thing farther than they think it ill?—ill for themselves,
                            for that, in their case, is ill in the abstract?—No, but the people will

                            few, has in all ages been established; the unfitness of the people,

                            you, that unlimited power in the hands of an individual is the best form
                            of government: I not only grant; but maintain, and can prove that it is
                            so. If you establish the unfitness of the people, I only insist upon one
                            thing, that the government be reduced at once to a simple despotism;
                            that the people <del>be subject to</del> have to endure the operations
                            of only one man’s power; that they be exempt from the insolence and
                            rapacity of a number of minor despots, in the shape of an aristocracy.
                            But who thinks of granting you the ground which you have most
                            unwarrantably assumed? By what argument have you proved the unfitness of
                            the people? You have never done anything but that which is disgraceful
                            to a man pretending to reason—you have never done any thing but beg the
                            question. Having given no reason to presume the people unfit, your
                            inference is sufficiently met by a simple rejection. My proposition is,
                            that the people always are the wisest portion of the community. The
                            ignorance and folly of lords and men of high rank, is even proverbial.
                            Who looks for talent or capacity among the men of large fortune? Not one
                            in a thousand of them can manage their own affairs. For the management
                            of every part of their own affairs they always chuse one of the people.
                            It is universally allowed, that in the middle rank is the greatest share
                            of wisdom and virtue. It is equally certain, that in any large portion
                            of mankind, the opinions of the greater number are always guided by
                            those of a number comparatively small. The middle rank in this way
                            govern those who are below them. It is not therefore true that if the
                            people are allowed to hear all that can be said in praise and all that
                            can be said in blame of political institutions and public men, and to
                            hear also those who will discriminate between the good and the evil,
                            that they will not be able to judge correctly. What should hinder them?
                            It is their interest. And there is no difficulty. —</p>

                            opinion. If the press acts in such a manner as to cure the depravity of

                        in their chronological order. <emph>Reform I</emph> here is clearly from the
                        same period as <emph>Liberty of the Press I</emph>; it consists almost
                        entirely of material that can be dated before 1812-14, and it has only one
                        piece that might be dated to 1817. The Cowper poem, Tirocinium, at <ref
                            target="cpb1ch4scrap61v">61v</ref>, has been referenced to an 1817
                        edition because elsewhere, Mill gave a precise page reference which can only
                        come from the Works of 1817. Even the apparently ‘late’ item, Bentham’s Plan
                        of Parliamentary Reform, of 1817 (<ref target="cpb1ch4scrap43v">43v</ref>),
                        was probably familiar to Mill much earlier. As Bentham makes clear in § 1 of
                        the Plan, the pamphlet was finished in 1809, and offered for publication
                        then, a time when Mill was working rather closely with Bentham; there are
                        even traces of Mill’s handwriting on some of the Bentham manuscripts of this
                        period. Note the Bentham manuscript from this time pasted in at <ref

                        being in <emph>Reform I</emph>; this does not date the section
                        unambiguously, however, as <emph>Reform II</emph> runs directly into
                            <emph>Reform I</emph>. He also refers back to the <emph>Reform I</emph>

                            being taxed with their own consent—they are taxed by the consent of the

                            fear of being contradicted by any facts, that it was not in his power,
                            nor in the power of any other man in his place. But it was because
                            consent had been refused so long; and because when it was given, it was
                            given with so many circumstances instructive of bad faith—it was for
                            those reasons that it was so violent—and from the same reasons it partly
                            arose that it was so unsuccessful, so unfortunate. Now if to France a
                            crisis came when reform could not be warded off; and if by warding it
                            off till things came to an extremity, reform became revolution, are the
                            antijacobins sure, that things are not proceeding in England, by
                            irresistible steps, to the same necessity for reform—if so, is it sure,
                            that driving affairs to extremity by resistance, may not produce the
                            same violent effects as in France?</p>
                        <p>It is the constitution of England, (so it is said) that no man shall have
                            his property taken from him without his consent.—So, too, our most
                            approved writers. Locke, <emph>On Government</emph>, § 138, says, “The
                            Supreme Power cannot”—(meaning not in England, but every where, cannot
                            by right and justice)—“take from any man part of his property
                                without his own consent … men have such right to the goods which by
                                the law of the community are theirs,</p><pb/>

                                all; for I have truly no property in that which another can by right
                                take from me, when he pleases against my consent.” According
                            to this doctrine, the English are without property—for as a majority of
                            the members of the House of Commons are elected by 154 individuals, the
                            king and these 154 are the hereditary masters of the property of the
                            people. This is the real state of the facts. No one denies it. Then it
                            only remains to ascertain what sort of government it is that is composed
                            of 155 hereditary owners, one of the 155 being the hereditary head. This
                            is the British constitution, just as it stands. It is worth the

                            which have had more—therefore it has the just proportion. This objection

                        <p>Nothing can exceed the alarm into which we in England have been thrown in
                            fear of the influence of French revolutionary principles. Some people
                            have regarded those fears as altogether unfounded—Scarcely any body so
                            bigoted who does not regard them as far more violent than any real
                            chance of danger sufficed to justify.—Well—let us now compare the people
                            of France and ourselves—let us compare their peculiar cause of alarm and
                            our peculiar cause of alarm. Their peculiar cause of alarm, during the
                            first years of the revolution, was—lest the agents and adherents of
                            royalty should succeed in subverting the revolution. Were not men in
                            this situation (let us enter into the principles of our own nature) as
                            naturally exposed to those fears as men in our situation to ours? If we
                            recollect the extravagances into which our fears led us—the violent
                            measures of government to which they led us to submit, shall we not
                            think that the people of France giving way to, or precipitating
                            themselves into violences of another sort, was only a conduct parallel
                            to our own?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">R</hi> But for influence, parliament, by witholding
                            supplies, might engross all the powers of government. So says Hume—so
                            says etc., etc. Looking only at a parliament such as the present—a
                            parliament independent, or little less than independent of the people—A
                            man may justly form such a notion. But it is strange that the persons
                            who bring forward this doctrine are negligent enough not to reflect that
                            the proposal is—to put a period to that independence—to render elections
                            annual—and in that case, as Hume himself acknowledges (see
                                <emph>Hist</emph>., v. 6, Note Z, p. 578) parliament would be

                        <p>Burke and others make a parade with contracts. Society has contracted to
                            keep its present government. If it has made any such contract, the best
                            thing it can do, is to break it. What preach the breaking of contracts,
                            villain, rascal, thief, cutthroat, Jacobin! Break a contract, why not?
                            if it ought to be broken. Are there any contracts that ought to be
                            broken? Oh yes there are—plenty. Who says so? Every body says so—the
                            British law says so. Why, Mr. Antijacobin, society could not subsist, if
                            it were not lawful to break contracts! <note>For Burke on contracts in

                        <p>It would, on your doctrine, only be necessary to get a man to contract to
                            kill the king, and then it would be obligatory on him to do so. Why,
                            Sir, the law invites and rewards men for breaking contracts—it rewards
                            felons for betraying their associates. What are contracts good for?—for

                            Hume is speaking of the call for reform in the days of Charles the 1st.
                                “It would be impossible, they thought, when all these
                                pretensions were methodized, and <hi rend="underline">prosecuted by

                        <p>What would the enemies of reform have done but for the French revolution?
                            To your Windhams—your Pitts—your priests—your lawyers—it was a true gift
                            from heaven. The age had become an age of liberal ideas, and encouraged
                            beneficent views—the progress was rapid—and had just reached the point
                            where many important changes for the good of mankind, must have been
                            speedily effected. The French revolution came; and it must be avowed
                            that the foes of liberal, of beneficent, of philanthropic ideas, made
                            the most of it. What a handle to the great high priests of
                            illiberality—the champions of misgovernment?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">R</hi> The argument of the people who preach for
                            influence proves that the king is absolute. But for influence, say they,
                            the House of Commons would render itself absolute. The House of Commons
                            then has on the right hand, the prospect, nay the certainty of absolute
                            power—on the left hand the good things the king has to bestow. The good
                            things are an over balance for the absolute power. Now as the attainment
                            of absolute power within reach, is the strongest of human motives,
                            surely far stronger than the love of public good, the influence of the
                            crown, in being more powerful, than the most powerful motive, is <hi

                            House of Commons. The arguers look only to the present house. Whereas
                            the point they are contesting implies a very different one. An
                            independent parliament with the king dependent upon it, would only be an
                            absolute aristocracy. A parliament dependent upon the people, with the
                            exercise of the kingly power moulded by dependence upon them, only
                            ensures that preponderance to the will, and hence the interests of the
                            people, which the interests of the people in moulding the operations of
                            government ought always to possess. <note>Paley, <emph>The Principles of

                            turbulent fellows, to think of the revolution. The world has been always
                            progressive—therefore there was never any need of reform. This is the

                            power, but in the body of the people. To whatever hands the powers of

                            the owners will always have an interest opposite to that of the many—Add

                                Lord Coke long ago told us, ‘the wisdom of all the wise men in the

                                equalled,’ which some of our wisest men who were met together long
                                before, said, was too good to be altered in any particular; and
                                which nevertheless hath been mending ever since, by a very number of
                                the said wise men: if, I say, this constitution should be imperfect,

                                being made the consequence of measures and operations, was always
                                put foremost; by a particular confidence between Lord Harrington and
                                the King, that point has employed, since their journey to Hanover,
                                solely their attention there, and no confidence, nor concert of
                                measures taken with the ministry here; but after things have been
                                resolved by Hanoverian counsels, ensnaring questions have been sent,
                                etc. … Having said this much in great confidence, which you will
                                easily believe, from the nature of it, I would not have said to any

                                they could wish that the cottage on the other side was less
                                regarded, and more affection was shewn to the tenants here, yet they
                                cannot abandon their old master and his family, though they think
                                the favourite steward acts with too much arrogance and

                                off. A certain person feels many pangs and throes; but I perceive,
                                plainly, his principal midwife does not undertake to deliver him,
                                and he (notwithstanding his partiality to him) does not rely upon
                                him. I have gone thus far in metaphor, and, indeed, I know not how
                                to describe the scene upon paper in plain words. Imagine to yourself
                                a situation, where a man wants to bring about what he sees is
                                impracticable, won’t enable the old servants to his family to do his
                                business; and yet is convinced that those whom he is more inclined
                                to cannot carry it on; wishing on one side, and embarrassing on the
                                other; and then you have the picture of the present family.”

                            giving the people rights—is—that men will always do mischief, when not
                            compelled by force. We answer they will not. Why because it is not their
                            interest. Government is the interest of all men. But they will not see
                            that interest. Yes, they will. The people of the stock exchange are a
                            proof of this, who pay their debts, though there is no law to compell
                            them. Indeed those who talk of the propensity of the people to
                            non-obedience forget that without obedience there is no government; they
                            can only use force against one part, by the obedience of the other. It
                            is because one part of the people are obedient, that governments have
                            the means of employing force against another part.</p>

                                1776.—“It is but fair, when one quits one’s party, to give
                                notice to those one abandons—at least, modern patriots, who often
                                imbibe their principles of honour at Newmarket, use that civility.
                                You and I, dear Sir, have often agreed in our political notions; and
                                you, I fear, will die, without changing your opinion. For my part, I
                                must confess, I am totally altered; and instead of being a warm
                                partisan of liberty, now admire nothing but despotism. You will
                                naturally ask what place I have gotten, or what bribe I have taken!
                                Those are the criterions of political changes in England—but as my
                                conversion is of foreign extraction, I shall not be the richer for

                                shocked at the conduct of the parliament—one would think it was an

                                the poor, and who employs his wicked eloquence to tempt the good
                                young monarch, by personal views, to sacrifice the mass of his
                                subjects to the privileges of the few—But why do I call it
                                eloquence? The fumes of interest had so clouded his rhetoric, that
                                he falls into a downright Iricism.—He tells the king, that the
                                intended tax on the proprietors of land will affect the property not
                                only of the rich, but of the poor. I should be glad to know what is
                                the property of the poor? Have the poor landed estates? Are those
                                who have landed estates the poor? Are the poor that will suffer by

                                prove any thing. Even good kings, and good ministers, if such have
                                been, may have erred; nay, may have done the best they could. They
                                would not have been good, if they wished their errors should be

                        <p>In short, Sir, I think this resistance of the parliament to the
                                adorable reformation planned by Messrs. de Turgot and Malesherbes,
                                is more phlegmaticly scandalous than the wildest tyranny of
                                despotism. I forgot what the nation was that refused liberty when it
                                was offered. This opposition to so noble a work is worse. A whole
                                people may refuse its own happiness; but these profligate
                                magistrates resist happiness for others, for millions, for
                                posterity!—Nay, do they not half vindicate Maupeou, who crushed
                                them? …</p>
                        <p>I beg your pardon, Sir, for giving you this long trouble; but I
                                could not help venting myself, when shocked to find such renegade
                                conduct in a parliament that I was rejoiced had been restored. Poor
                                human kind! is it always to breed serpents from its own bowels? In
                                our country it chuses its representatives, and they sell it and
                                themselves—in others it exalts despots—in another it resists the
                                despot when he consults the good of the people!—Can we wonder
                                mankind is wretched, when men are such beings? Parliaments run wild
                                with loyalty, when America is to be enslaved or butchered. They
                                rebel when their country is to be set free! …”</p>

                        <p>The Same to the Rev. William Mason (no date). “The purport of Dr.
                                Robertson’s visit was to inquire where he could find materials for
                                the reigns of king William and queen Anne, which he means to write
                                as a supplement to David Hume. I had heard of his purpose, but did
                                not own I knew it, that my discouragement might seem the more
                                natural. I do not care a straw what he writes about the church’s
                                wet-nurse, goody Anne; but no Scot is worthy of being the historian
                                of William, but Doctor Watson.</p>
                        <p>When he told
                                me his object, I said, ‘write the reign of king William, doctor
                                Robertson! That is a great task! I look on him as the greatest man
                                of modern times since his ancestor William Prince of Orange.’ I soon
                                found the doctor had very little idea of him, or had taken upon
                                trust the pitiful partialities of Dalrymple and Macpherson. I said,
                                ‘Sir I do not doubt but king William came over with a view to the

                                upon by patriotism etc.’ … The doctor, suspecting that I doubted his
                                principles being enlarged enough to do justice to so great a
                                character, told me he himself had been born and bred a whig, though
                                he owned he was a moderate one—I believe, a very moderate one. I
                                said Macpherson had done great injustice to another hero, the duke
                                of Marlborough, whom he accuses of betraying the design on Brest to
                                Louis XIV. … In short, I endeavoured to impress him with proper
                                ideas of his subject, and painted to him the difficulties, and the
                                want of materials. But the booksellers will outargue me, and the
                                doctor will forget his education—<emph>Panem et Circenses</emph>, if

                                William; but his Charles V and his America have opened my eyes, and
                                the times have shut his. Adieu!” Lord Orford’s

                            it is over with the constitution.—The king is master of the houses of
                            Lords and commons; and without a mystery unites in his own person the
                            three branches of the legislature. Chesterfield’s <emph>Miscellaneous
                                Works</emph>, v. 4, in two of his last letters to Ld. Stair—the
                            passage marked on blank leaf at the end in Mr. Bentham’s copy.

                                and xcvii, in <emph>Miscellaneous Works</emph>, IV 378.
                                Chesterfield’s reference is to the bill restricting the number of
                                placemen in parliament. He suggests that “while the houses of
                                    lords and commons are absolutely in the power of the crown, as
                                    they visibly now are, we have no constitution, and the crown
                                    alone is, without a mystery, the three branches of the
                                    legislature.”</note></p>
                        <p>According to high church the constitution cannot be denied to be
                            imperfect—for they say it canot stand without a church—It must therefore
                            be a wretched fabric—if it cannot stand without a church, it cannot too
                            be put in a state to stand without it. <note>Mill is probably referring
                                to the type of argument found in William Warburton’s <emph>The

                                    believe takes wiser thought for their interests than they

                            keeps the citizens at their work, when, (as in the latter state of

                                And he was as much troubled when the crown exceeded its just limits,

                        <p>It is said that a great part of men’s obedience to laws proceeds from the

                            evil.—Christianity was a pretty sturdy change—so was the reformation.
                            Every conquest effected is a pretty sturdy change. Are kings therefore
                            afraid to conquer? The fact is—there is never any difficulty on the part
                            of governors to change one way, viz., to add to the weight of men’s
                            chains.—If habit makes men obey, when are they ever without that habit?

                        <p>Fra Paolo informs us, that when Pope Adrian, urged by the progress of
                                <del>the Reformation, &amp;</del> Luther, and his sense of the
                            corruptions of the church, formed the resolution of beginning reform,
                            the Cardinal Soderini, dissuaded him from it in the following words.
                                “He commended his goodness, his ingenuity, and his mind
                                inclined to the reformation of the Church, and the rooting out of
                                heresies, adding, notwithstanding, that he could not have praise by
                                his good intention onely, not able to do good by itself, unlesse he
                                joyned thereunto an exact choice of fit meanes, and an execution
                                managed with the greatest circumspection. But when he saw him
                                constrained by the straitnesse of time to resolve, he told him there
                                was no hope to confound and root out the Lutherans by correcting the
                                manners of the Court, but rather that it would be a meanes to
                                augment their credit much more. For the people, who alwaies judge by
                                the events, when they shall be assured, by the following amendment,
                                that the Pope’s government was justly reprehended, will perswade
                                themselves likewise, that the other innovations proposed have good
                                foundation, and the arch heretiques, seeing they have overcome in
                                one part, will not cease to reprehend the rest. That in all human
                                affairs it falleth out, that to receive satisfaction in some
                                requests, giveth pretence to prepare more, and to thinke they are
                                due. That reading the stories past, of the times when heresies have
                                bin raised against the authority of the Church of Rome, it will
                                appeare, that all took pretence from the corrupted manners of the
                                Court. Neverthelesse, never any Pope thought fit to reforme them,
                                but after admonitions and instructions used, to induce the Princes
                                to protect the Church. That, whatsoever hath succeeded well
                                heretofore, ought alwayes to bee observed and kept. That nothing did
                                more ruine a governement, than to change the manner of ruling it.
                                That to open new wayes not used, was to expose himselfe to great
                                dangers, [and that it was most secure to tread in the steppes of the
                                holy Popes, who alwayes have brought their enterprises to a
                                prosperous end.] That no man hath ever extinguished heresies by
                                reformations, but by Crusadoes, and by exciting Princes and people

                        <p>At the interview of the Pope with the Emperor at Bologna, the former said
                            to the latter, “that the heresy had infected two sorts of
                                persons, the multitude, and the Princes and Grandies: that it was
                                probable that the multitude was deceived, but to give it
                                satisfaction in the demand of a Councell, was not to give it more
                                light, but to bring in popular licence. If it were granted unto them
                                to make question, or to seeke greater perspicuity in religion, they
                                would immediately pretend also to give laws for government, and to
                                restraine the authority of Princes by Decrees: and when they have
                                obtained to examine and discusse the Ecclesiastical authority, they
                                will learne also to trouble the temporall. He shewed him that it was
                                more easie to oppose the first demands of a multitude, than after
                                they had been gratified in part, to prescribe them a measure. For
                                the Princes and Grandies, he might assure himselfe, that their end
                                was not piety, but the making themselves Lords of the Ecclesiastical
                                goods; and being become absolute, to acknowledge the Emperor nothing
                                at all, or very little. … Against which, if he would make provision,
                                he had no other meanes, than severely to imploy his authority and
                                power, while the greater part obeyed him: wherein expedition was
                                necessary, before the number increased, and the profit were

                            commissioned a few cardinals and prelates of his confidence, to draw up
                            a scheme of reform, for some of the most objectionable things, the
                            cardinal of Capua, “shewed in a long discourse, that that time
                                comported not any reformation at all. First, he put them in minde of

                                because it is in use, is not so much marvelled at, than by

                                appeare greater, and be more reprehended. He added that it would

                        <p><hi rend="bold">R</hi> Such were the reasons which urged and were
                            sufficient to persuade the church to resist reform, even at the moment
                            when things had now reached a point of maturity, and reform was
                            inevitable. When the revolt arrived, and the church had evidently
                            received that fatal blow [from] which it could never recover, a very
                            different language about reform was held by the most zealous advocates
                            of the church. The language then held was, that the imprudent,
                            dangerous, and vicious opposition to reform, was the true cause of the
                            insurrection against the church. Bossuet begins his celebrated work,
                                <emph>Hist. des Variations des Eglises Protestantes</emph>, in these
                            words, “A
                                reformation of ecclesiastical discipline had been desired several
                                ages since. ‘Who will grant me,’ says St. Bernard, ‘before I die, to
                                see the church of God such as she had been in the primitive times?’
                                If this holy man had any thing to regret at his death, it was, that
                                he had not witnessed so happy a change. During his whole life he
                                bewailed the evils of the church: he never ceased to admonish the
                                people, the clergy, the bishops, and the Popes themselves of them.
                                Nor did he conceal his sentiments on the subject from his own
                                religion, who partook of his affliction in their solitude, and
                                extolled the Divine goodness in having drawn them to it so much the
                                more gratefully, as the world was more universally corrupted.
                                Disorders had still increased since that time. The Roman church, the
                                mother of churches, which for nine whole ages had, by setting the
                                example of an exact observance of ecclesiastical discipline,
                                maintained it throughout the universe to her utmost power, was not
                                exempt from evil; and from the time of the council of Vienne, a
                                great prelate, commissioned by the Pope to prepare matters there to
                                be discussed, laid it down as a groundwork to this holy assembly,
                                    ‘<emph>to reform the church in the head and members</emph>.’ …
                                The disorders of the clergy, chiefly those of Germany, were
                                represented in this manner to Eugenius IV by Cardinal Julian. ‘These
                                disorders,’ said he, ‘excite the hatred of the people against the
                                whole ecclesiastical order, and should they not be corrected, it is
                                to be feared lest the laity, like the Hussites, should rise against
                                the clergy, as they loudly threaten us.’ … Thus in the fifteenth
                                century, did this Cardinal, the greatest man of his time, lament the
                                abuses of those days, and foresee their alarming consequences. He
                                seems to have foretold those evils in which Luther was about to
                                involve all Christendom, beginning with Germany. Nor was

                        <p>mistaken, when
                                he supposed that a reformation which was despised, and a hatred
                                redoubled against the clergy, would speedily bring forth a sect more
                                terrible to the church than that of the Bohemians … There were then
                                two different sorts of persons, who called for the reformation; one,
                                the truly peaceable and true children of the church, without
                                bitterness bewailed her grievances, and, with respect, proposed a
                                reformation of them, and in humility bore with a delay. Far from
                                desiring to effect this object by schism, they, on the contrary,
                                looked on schism as the greatest of all evils. In the midst of these
                                abuses, they admired the providence of God, who, according to his
                                promises, knew how to preserve the faith of the church. And, though
                                they could not accomplish a reformation of morals, free from all
                                bitterness and passion, they deemed themselves happy that nothing
                                prevented them from accomplishing it in themselves. These were the
                                strong ones of the church, whose faith no temptation could shake nor
                                induce to deviate from unity. Besides these, there were proud
                                spirits, who, struck with the disorders they saw prevailing in the
                                church, especially in her ministers, did not believe the promises of
                                her eternal duration could subsist in the midst of such abuses; […]
                                these became proud, and thereby weak, yielding to the temptation
                                which inclines to hate the chair itself, in hatred to those who sat
                                upon it; and, as if the wickedness of man could make void the work
                                of God, the aversion they had conceived against the teachers, made
                                them both hate the doctrines they taught, and the authority they had
                                received from God to teach.” [F] Bossuet, <emph>Hist. des

                            of the two sorts of reformers is highly instructive. The one is the
                            archetype and pattern of our moderate reformers. The other of our
                            thorough reformers. The first sort are those under whose efforts, the
                            church would have remained till thus [<emph>sic</emph> this] hour
                            unreformed; whose patient, humble remonstrances would have been a feeble
                            opponent to the mighty interests created in the leading and powerful
                            hands by the increase of the abuses. The latter sort of reformers, were
                            the Luthers, the Calvins, the men who really did the business; the
                            Jacobins of their own day, the perturbators, etc., etc., but at the same
                            time the grand benefactors of the human race. <note>J.B. Bossuet,

                            “Most European governments are monarchies; at least that is what
                                they are called, for I do not know that there have ever been such
                                things. At any rate, it would have been difficult for them to have
                                existed for long in a pure form. Monarchy is a state of tension,
                                which always degenerates into despotism or republicanism. Power can
                                never be divided equally between prince and people, it is too
                                difficult to keep the balance. The power must necessarily decrease
                                on one side and increase on the other, but usually the ruler is at
                                an advantage, being in control of the armed forces.” [F]

                                and so great a friend to the Romans. That may be, answered Cato, but
                                I look upon a king as a creature that lives [<emph>sic</emph> feeds]
                                upon flesh; and of all the kings that have been so much cried up, I

                                I was confident our liberty could never be placed upon a firm
                                foundation, until that ancient law were restored among us. For, who
                                sees not, that while such assemblies are permitted to have a longer
                                duration, there grows up a commerce of corruption between the
                                ministry and the deputies, wherein they both find their accounts, to
                                the manifest danger of liberty; which traffic would neither answer
                                the design nor expense, if parliaments met once a year.”

                            which letter Warburton declares—“No piece of Swift contains more

                                reformation. It is hard to persuade them that there can be any thing

                            importance. Those who loll at their ease in high dignities are the

                                >st</hi>, 1732, Sir William Wyndham said, “One of the
                                great evils of a salt tax, I may say the greatest, because it
                                strikes at our constitution, is the great number of officers who
                                must be employed in collecting that small branch of the revenue.
                                Those officers are all named by the crown, and being spread all over
                                the country, must have a great influence in elections. This throws a
                                greater power into the hands of the crown, than is in my opinion
                                consistent with the liberties of this nation. If ever it shall
                                happen to be the misfortune of this nation to have a [set] of wicked
                                ministers in the administration, and a weak or an ambitious prince
                                upon the throne, the great number of officers employed in collecting
                                the public revenue must be of the most dangerous consequence to our

                                in its favour. This is the natural and just influence which the
                                crown ought to have, and I hope it will never have any

                        <p>The tendency of limited monarchy to degenerate into despotism is well
                            expressed by Montesquieu: “Most European governments are
                                monarchies; at least that is what they are called, for I do not know
                                that there have ever been such things. At any rate, it would have
                                been difficult for them to have existed for long in a pure form.
                                Monarchy is a state of tension, which always degenerates into
                                despotism or republicanism. Power can never be divided equally
                                between prince and people, it is too difficult to keep the balance.
                                The power must necessarily decrease on one side and increase on the
                                other, but usually the ruler is at an advantage, being in control of
                                the armed forces. Thus the power of European kings is very great,
                                and they can be said to have as much of it as they want; but they do
                                not use it to the same extent as our sultans, first, because they do
                                not want to go against their peoples’ customs and religious beliefs,
                                and second, because it is not in their interest to carry it so

                                that every abuse of power might always be reformed in it.—Carthage
                                was destroyed, because, when abuses were to be retrenched, the
                                citizens could not bear the hand even of their Hannibal. Athens
                                fell, because the errors of the people appeared so lovely in their
                                own eyes, that they would not be cured of them: and among us, those
                                Italian republics which boast of nothing but the perpetuity of their
                                abuses; nor indeed, do they enjoy greater liberty than Rome did
                                under the Decemvirs. … In a word, free government, that is to say,

                            “As a law
                                directed against the mass of a nation has not the nature of a
                                reasonable institution, so neither has it the authority: for in all
                                governments the People is the true legislator; and whether the
                                immediate and instrumental cause of the law be a single person, or
                                many, the remote and efficient cause is the consent of the People,
                                either actual or implied;—and such consent is absolutely essential
                                to its validity. To the solid establishment of every law two things
                                are essentially requisite: first, a proper and sufficient human
                                power to declare and modify the matter of the law, and next, such a
                                fit and equitable constitution as they have a right to declare and
                                render binding. With regard to the first requisite, the human
                                authority, it is their judgement they give up, not their right. The
                                people, indeed, are presumed to consent to whatever the Legislature
                                ordains for their benefit; and they are to acquiesce in it, though
                                they do not clearly see into the propriety of the means by which
                                they are conducted to that desirable end. … But if we could suppose
                                that such a ratification” (namely of a law clearly injurious
                            to the majority) “was made, not virtually, but actually; by the
                                people, not representatively, but even collectively; still it would
                                be null and void. They have no right to make a law prejudicial to
                                the whole community, even though the delinquents, in
                            making</p><pb/>

                                should be themselves the chief sufferers by it; because it would be
                                against the principle of a superior law, which it is not in the
                                power of any community, or of the whole race of man to alter—I mean
                                the will of Him who gave us our nature, and in giving impressed an
                                invariable Law upon it. It would be hard to point out any error more
                                truly subversive of all the order and beauty, of all the peace and
                                happiness of human society, than the position, that any body of men
                                have a right to make what laws they please, or that laws can derive
                                any authority from their institution, merely, and independent of the
                                quality of the subject matter. No arguments of policy, reason of
                                state, or preservation of the constitution, can be pleaded in favour
                                of such a practice. They may, indeed, impeach the frame of that
                                constitution; but can never touch this immoveable principle. This
                                seems to be indeed the doctrine which Hobbes broached in the last
                                century, and which was then so frequently and so ably refuted.
                                Cicero exclaims with the utmost indignation and contempt against
                                such a notion; he considers it not only as unworthy of a
                                philosopher, but of an illiterate peasant. (<emph>De Leg., l</emph>.
                                i, 15, 16) … In reality there are two, and only two, foundations of
                                Law; and they are both of them conditions without which nothing can
                                give it any force; I mean equity and utility. With respect to the
                                former, it grows out of the great rule of equality, which is
                                grounded upon our common nature, and which Philo, with propriety and
                                beauty, calls the Mother of Justice. All human laws are, properly
                                speaking, only declaratory; they may alter the mode and application,
                                but have no power over the substance of original justice. The other
                                foundation of Law, which is utility, must be understood, not of
                                partial or limited, but of general and public utility. … If this
                                principle be denied or evaded, what ground have we left to reason
                                on? We must at once make a total change in all our ideas, and look
                                for a new definition of Law. Where to find it, I confess myself at a
                                loss. … Partiality and Law are contradictory terms. Neither the
                                merits, nor the ill deserts, neither the wealth and importance, nor
                                the indigence and obscurity of the one part or of the other, can
                                make any alteration in this fundamental truth. On any other scheme I
                                defy any man living to settle a correct standard, which may
                                discriminate between equitable rule and the most direct tyranny. For
                                if we can once prevail upon ourselves to depart from the strictness
                                and integrity of this principle, in favour even of a considerable
                                party, the argument will hold for one that is less so; and thus we
                                shall go on, narrowing the bottom of public right, until step by
                                step we arrive, though after no very long or very forced deduction,
                                at what one of our poets calls the enormous faith; the faith of—the
                                many created for the advantage of a single person.”

                                driven farther from the perpendicular; till, at last, the decisive
                                blow is given, and down it comes. Every million that has been raised
                                within the last century has had an effect upon the constitution,
                                like that of a blow from the aforesaid ram, upon the aforesaid wall.
                                The impulse becomes more and more important, and the impression it
                                makes is continually augmented; unless therefore something
                                extraordinary intervenes to prevent it—you will find the consequence

                        <p>The town of Rochelle was held by the Hugonots, and with a high spirit of
                            liberty. Henry the Fourth was reproached for the little power which he
                            possessed in that seat of his friends, and of his primary faith. The
                            answer is one which will not often be made by kings, but which their
                            subjects should never suffer them to forget. “I do (said

                        <p>“This contention about East-Indian patronage seems not unlikely to
                                avenge upon us, by its consequences, the mischiefs we have done
                                there. The matter in dispute is too precious to be relinquished by
                                either party; and each is jealous of the influence the other would
                                derive from the possession of it. In a country, whose politics have
                                so long rolled upon the wheels of corruption, an affair of such
                                value must prove a weight in either scale; absolutely destructive of
                                the very idea of a balance. Every man has his sentiments upon the
                                subject, and I have mine. Were I constituted umpire of this strife,
                                with full powers to decide it, I would tie a talent of lead about
                                the neck of this patronage, and plunge it into the depths of the
                                sea. To speak less figuratively, I would abandon all territorial
                                interest in a country, to which we have no right, and which we
                                cannot govern with any security to the happiness of the inhabitants,
                                or without the danger of incurring either perpetual broils, or the
                                most insupportable tyranny at home. That sort of tyranny I mean
                                which flatters and tantalizes the subject with a show of freedom,
                                and in reality allows him nothing more, bribing to the right and
                                left, rich enough to afford the purchase of a thousand consciences,
                                and consequently strong enough, if it happens to meet with an
                                incorruptible one, to render all the efforts of that man, or of

                                securing subjects against the encroachment of governors. Power is
                                always gradually stealing away from the many to the few, because the
                                few are more vigilant and consistent; it still contracts to a
                                smaller number, till in time it centers in a single person.—Thus all
                                the form[s] of government instituted among mankind, perpetually tend
                                towards monarchy; and power, however diffused through the whole

                                to the overseeing of dioceses, to expunge the Athanasian Creed from
                                our liturgy, to free dissenters from test-acts, and the ministers of
                                the establishment from subscription to human articles of faith.
                                These, and other matters respecting the church, ought to be done. …
                                As to the civil state, it cannot continue long as it is. One
                                minister in subserviency to the will of his master, doubles the
                                national debt and dismembers the empire; and is instantly taken into
                                the confidence of those who threatened to take his head. Another
                                expends millions on measures grounded on his own ambition,
                                insolence, or temerity, and finds means of inducing a great majority
                                in both houses of parliament to place confidence in his wisdom.—The
                                people will, in time, see, that they have no reason to place
                                confidence in any party; that every party in its turn ennobles its
                                opulent friends, and enriches its poorer supporters, at the public
                                expense. But I will forbear politics; I love my country, and cannot
                                see its decline in principle, and the increase of that corruption

                            replies, “That such persons argue as ill, as if the savage people of America
                                should deny there were any grounds, or principles of reason, so to
                                build a house as to last as long as the materials, because they
                                never yet saw any so well built. Time, and industry, produce every
                                day new knowledge. And, as the art of well building is derived from
                                principles of reason, observed by industrious men, that had long

                                proportion, long after mankind began (though poorly) to build: So,
                                long time after men have begun to constitute commonwealths,
                                imperfect, and apt to relapse into disorder, there may principles of
                                reason be found out, by industrious meditation, to make their

                                and learned men, any thing that discovereth their errors, and
                                thereby lesseneth their authority. Whereas, the common people’s

                            from their want of a common interest, and hence of a common sympathy
                            with the rest of mankind. [“The generality of men, assured of
                                their subsistence, and without concern on that account, become
                                insensible: they do not deplore in others the evils they cannot
                                experience. …] In fact, what is it that produces in man the
                                sentiment of benevolence? The assistance, either remote or near,
                                that they may afford each other. This is the principle that unites
                                men in society. Do the laws estrange my interest from that of the
                                public? From that moment I become wicked. Hence the severity of
                                arbitrary governments, and the reason why monks and despots are in
                                general the most inhuman of men.” [F] Helvet., <emph>De

                            wretched principle on which the system of Roman laws was formed, “One
                            deduces there,” says he, “several measures to follow: but these
                                particular reforms, made on a general plan that leaves [the whole]
                                to remain, serve only to put confusion, disarray, and contradiction
                                in a system, where, up to then, the whole had been linked,
                                connected, and consistent.” [F] Pilati, <emph>Traite des
                                loix civ</emph>., 1 Partie, ch. 4, p. 147. A bad system may only be
                            made worse by partial reforms. That which had in it a certain degree of
                            cohesion and order, may thus have confusion and disorder added to its
                            other vices. <note>Pilati, <emph>Traité des loix civiles</emph>, I 147,

                        <p>Speaking of these partial corrections, without altering the system,
                            introduced into the Roman law, by the prætors, the same author says,
                                “It is, however, a fact that in law emendations can only
                                increase the mischief, and put confusion in where there was none
                                before. In this kind of matter, one must cut down to the roots, or
                                nothing is changed. Without that precaution, the civil laws of all
                                the countries of Europe are only accumulations of confused and
                                disconnected things.” [F] <emph>Ibid</emph>., p. 150 [c.

                            historical fact. The passion for acquiring riches was there as intense
                            as ever it was any where in the world. By consequence, the advantages
                            which it gave were as great. Demosthenes, <emph>adv. Aristoc</emph>.,

                            built houses grander, than the public buildings of the state, and had

                            this be their disposition, to do so now? Have not the people always
                            power? Is not all power the people’s? Is not all government founded upon
                            their opinion? Do you say that the people are never persuaded that it
                            would not be safe for them? But if you can persuade the people to all
                            manner of things hurtful and pernicious to them, why despair of
                            persuading them to acquiesce in things to their advantage? If you can

                            them hereafter to their benefit. The people have always been persuaded
                            to obey, otherwise government could not have existed. Is it not strange,
                            you should believe that the people should then only become incapable of
                            being persuaded, when the persuasion ceases to be directed to their
                            hurt, and desires them only to follow their own advantage? This is the

                            says, “Besides those whose improvements and informations are
                                straitened by the narrowness of their fortunes, there are others,
                                whose largeness of fortune would plentifully enough supply books,
                                and other requisites for clearing of doubts, and discovering truth;
                                but they are cooped in close by the laws of their countries, and the

                                inquiry, than those poor and wretched labourers we before spoke of;
                                and however they may seem high and great, are confined to narrowness
                                of thought, and enslaved in that which should be the freest part of
                                man, their understandings. This is generally the case of all those
                                who live in places, where care is taken to propagate truth without
                                knowledge; where men are forced, at a venture, to be of the religion
                                of the country; and must, therefore, swallow down opinions, as silly
                                people do empirics’ pills, without knowing what they are made of, or
                                how they will work, and have nothing to do but believe they will do
                                the cure; but in this are much more miserable than they, in that
                                they are not at liberty to refuse swallowing what perhaps they had

                                violent opposition started up. It was urged, that the act would thin
                                the country, by drawing away its inhabitants; […] that their
                                families would become a burden to the parish, and that they would be
                                reduced to distress, by having their small stock of chattels sold
                                up, to satisfy an hungry creditor. […] The question was warmly

                                year flowing into the pocket of a private attorney, was able to stop
                                the stream of justice, set 20,000 people in a flame, lock up the
                                senatorial powers of the nation, keep the door of fraud open,
                                deprive 10,000 persons of the means of recovering their effects, and
                                leave the generations unborn to regret the loss of the bill. Had the

                                not here give a character of his justice, without repetition, and
                                that of the panegyric kind. … But I may knowingly affirm, that his
                                integrity was untainted: And he never warped, to grieve any
                                adversary, for party, or in particular; nor was shy of doing right
                                to his friends for fear of obloquy, for he knew what he did, and
                                always gave reasons in public that would sustain it.—But he shewed
                                his universal good will by nothing more than a restlessness under
                                abuses, that tended to grieve mankind. No one can think any man, not
                                ambitious of doing good, could be so taken up with spying out what
                                was amiss, and suggesting remedies, as he was. … All the while his
                                lordship was chief justice of the common pleas, and had leisure, he
                                bent his thoughts very much to regulating what was amiss in the law.
                                For it is impossible but in process of time, as well from the nature
                                of things changing as corruption of agents, abuses will grow up; for
                                which reason the law must be kept as a garden, with frequent
                                digging, weeding, turning, etc. That which in one age was
                                convenient, and perhaps necessary, in another becomes an intolerable
                                nuisance.—His manner was, as any abuse, or regulation, came in his
                                mind (of which very many from the multitude of business that passed
                                him must happen) to set it down upon some bye-paper or book used for
                                noting. And then, upon a second view, and re-consideration, he
                                digested his thought, and brought what he had so digested into the

                        <p>Popular election is a great evil. Its distempers “have destroyed

                            cured. It is a false foundation for the defence of bad government.—You
                            allow that no good can be done without popular election: And it is not
                            true, that it may not be carried to the full extent, necessary to the
                            purposes of good government, without inconvenience.—According to this
                            argument of Burke, any thing like a good government is an utter
                            impossibility, and ever must remain. <note>“Speech on a Bill for

                        <p>To shorten the duration of parliaments would precipitate one of two

                            irresistible—or it would raise a furious popular spirit.

                            neither. <note>X 74.</note></p>
                        <p>The representative ought not to go to school to the represented, because
                            he ought to be the wiser of the two: he ought to consult his interest,
                            not his inclination. 376. Who told Mr. Burke, that frequency of election
                            would require any thing else? The represented, says Mr. B. is a perfect
                            judge of the honesty, or corruption of his representative—is there any
                            chance, that knowing his integrity, and having chosen him as a wise man,
                            he will not in all ordinary occasions defer to him in the detail of
                            measures? Is not the tendency of the people, proved by all history, to
                            defer too much? to trust too far? <note>X 76.</note></p>
                        <p>Shortening the duration of parliaments would increase the influence of
                            the crown. <emph>Ib</emph>., 377. Mr. Burke argues this upon the
                            supposition, that the state of the representation remained as before.
                            The expense, he says, would ruin all independence of fortune, and place
                            the whole system of representation in the minister’s hands. 377-380. Why
                            do not ministers, by that means, then, take the whole into their hands
                            at present? Expense, you say, will do it. Why do they not go to that
                            expense? Why do they not make the septennial election <del>as expensive
                                as</del> of double the present expense? Where they at present
                            succeed without a struggle, they have no occasion for more. Where at
                            present they fail, if money will do it, why do they stop? The answer is
                            plain. No body in the world can doubt, that the ministers do at present
                            all they can; expend at present the whole of their means of every sort.
                            But expending now the whole of their means of every sort, they could do
                            no more, if they were to expend them at twice. [<emph>sic</emph>] The
                            amount of expenditure would be the same. It would be only divided into
                            two portions. What is it that raises at present, the expense of
                            elections to their actual amount? Why, it is the competition of the
                            parties. And that competition implies that the means of both are
                            stretched to the utmost. If the independent candidates could go farther,
                            they would drive out the minister to a greater extent. If the minister
                            could go any farther, he would drive out the independent candidates to a
                            greater extent. <note>X 77-82.</note></p>

                            Mr. Burke adduces, the effects on morals. “What will be the

                                triennial idleness, triennial lawsuits, litigation, prosecutions,
                                triennial frenzy of society dissolved, industry interrupted, ruined;
                                of those personal hatreds that will never be suffered to soften;
                                those animosities and feuds which will be rendered immortal, those
                                quarrels which are never to be appeazed; morals vitiated and
                                gangrened to the vitals?”

                            footing. According to the plan of the reformers, all would be removed.
                            What is to be said of the virtue of the two aristocratical factions,
                            which cordially join in preventing the removal. Beside this, however,
                            the same answer applies to the morals, as to the influence. What
                            diminishes the expense on each occasion one half, diminishes all the
                            consequences of the expense. <note>X 82-3.</note></p>

                            it, from there being nothing in a triennial, or even any

                            prevent it. Mr. Burke says, that when seats in the Irish parliament were
                            for the life of the king, the cost was £1500, when for 8 years £2500.
                            This only proves that people had more to give for them; not that at the
                            latter period, they would not for a seat during the life of the king
                            have given even more. <note>X 84-5.</note></p>

                        <p>In favour of the constitution, as it stands, “What have you to
                                answer but this?—Our constitution is a prescriptive constitution, it
                                is a constitution whose sole authority is, that it has existed time
                                out of mind. … Prescription is the most solid of all titles, not
                                only to property, but, which is to secure that property, to
                                government. They harmonize with each other, and give mutual aid to
                                one another. It is accompanied with another ground of authority in
                                the constitution of the human mind, presumption. It is a presumption
                                in favour of any settled scheme of government against any untried
                                project, that a nation has long existed and flourished under it. It
                                is a better presumption even of the <emph>choice</emph> of a nation,
                                far better than any sudden and temporary arrangement by actual
                                election. … It is a deliberate election of ages and of generations;
                                it is a constitution made by what is ten thousand times better than
                                choice, it is made by the peculiar circumstances, occasions,
                                tempers, dispositions, and moral, civil, and social habitudes of the
                                people, which disclose themselves only in a long space of time. It
                                is a vestment which accommodates itself to the body. Nor is
                                prescription of government founded upon blind unmeaning
                                prejudices—for man is a most unwise and a most wise being. The
                                individual is foolish. The multitude for the moment is foolish, when
                                they act without deliberation; but the species is wise, and when
                                time is given to it, as a species it almost always acts
                                right.”
                            <emph>Ib</emph>., Speech on the Reform of Represent., V, 390. The
                            following observations are to be applied. “Good by prescription.” The
                            things that are said to be good by prescription, would have been either
                            good or bad without prescription. If good without it, i.e., <emph>per
                                se</emph>, nothing more in any case can possibly be desired. We must
                            suppose that things that are said to be good by prescription would have
                            been bad without it. They are things that can be defended on no other
                            ground, than that of old existence. They are <emph>mala per se</emph>
                            [bad in themselves], good only by reason of certain other things, which
                            are connected with them. If prescription renders bad things good; it
                            would have been still better if good things had been chosen at the
                            beginning, and prescription had been had in favour of</p><pb/>
                    </div>
                    <div xml:id="cpb1ch5scrap34r" n="34r" type="scrap">
                        <p>them. So, if we resolve upon good things now, time will give us
                            prescription in favour of them. But time, it will be said, has made an
                            adaptation of all things to all things. If you alter some things in the
                            system, you must alter all. To this argument many answers may be
                            returned. In the first place, allowing that bad things, by a long
                            operation, form adaptations between other things and themselves, it does
                            not follow, that substituting good things to the bad things, would
                            require any such changes in other things as would be very difficult to
                            introduce. Suppose by the long operation of some thing a man’s leg has
                            been held in a bad posture, till the muscles are contracted. There is no
                            doubt, that not only the contiguous muscles, but all the muscles in the
                            body are adapted to the bad habit, yet if by any operation of the
                            healing art, the contraction of these muscles can be redressed, the
                            other muscles are easily brought from the bad habit to the good one.
                            Another answer is, if it be taken as a general objection to the removal
                            of all old evils, that they have adapted other things to themselves, it
                            is undeniably and <del>unspeakably</del> conspicuously condemned and
                            scouted by the reason and practice of mankind; by whom on so many
                            occasions old evils have been removed without any regard to this
                            argument of the adaptation: if it is notoriously unworthy of regard as a
                            general answer to all removal of old evils, it is only good, if it is
                            ever good, where it applies to the particular circumstances of some
                            particular case, where in the particular circumstances of that
                            particular case the removal of the evil things, would by the other
                            changes which it would require, produce more <del>trouble</del>
                            inconvenience than the object is worth. For a third answer, we may
                            consider, what is the sort of adaptations which bad things make of other
                            things to themselves. They may be first, things to correct the bad
                            effects of the bad things. Get rid of the bad things, and you no longer
                            need them. They may secondly be things which co-operate with the bad
                            things to produce bad effects. The sooner you get rid of them the
                            better. Thirdly, they may be things which produce good effects, acting
                            along with the bad things; but could not be made to concur in useful
                            operation with good things. The things, however, which would concur in
                            useful operation with the good things, would produce still more good
                            effects. All then, which you have to include in the account is the
                            inconvenience of change; and about that no general rule can be given, it
                            must in every case be decided by the circumstances of that very case.
                            Upon the whole, it is plain, that this argument about prescription, is
                            nothing but the common fallacy of “No innovation.”</p>
                        <p>As a general argument against all improvement, this is exploded by the
                            general reason and general practice of mankind. Innovation never is or
                            can be bad, but in the particular merits of the particular case; where
                            the benefit sought is less than the benefit abandoned.—But Burke’s
                            argument farther is, that prescription, that is long usage, is a <hi
                                rend="underline">proof</hi> of goodness. If his rule is held in
                            obedience, that bad things, if once established, are to be held to for
                            ever because they are established, antiquity of usage is no proof of
                            goodness at all. Observe the mental proofs of this argument. You are to
                            keep to bad things, if they are once introduced: And if you keep to them
                            long, your very keeping to them will prove that they are good.
                            Prescription, says Burke, is a presumption of choice. True; but choice,
                            by <hi rend="underline">whom</hi>? Nothing in government, or in human
                            affairs, ever took place but by choice. The point of importance is, who
                            were the chusers? If the people were the chusers, Burke’s argument is
                            conclusive, “the species is wise,” and the choice would be right. If the
                            choice never has been by the people, but always by the people’s
                            oppressors, then, it is clear, the choice would be wrong. Good
                            government would give to the people the choice, and then as “the species
                            is wise,” the choice would be sure to be good.—Burke talks of
                            prescription to government</p><pb/>

                            intrinsically different. Prescription to government means antiquity of
                            the institution. Property as an institution exists always and without
                            dispute; it is only the title of an individual to some portion of it,
                            that gets the name of prescription. The title of an individual to some
                            portion of the powers of government is not what Burke means by
                            prescription to government. To make good prescription to property, that
                            is to maintain the title of an individual to some particular portion of
                            it, is a very different thing from maintaining that a bad institution of
                            government ought not to be changed. <note>“Speech on the Reform

                            evil effects which it produces. And is any body ready to declare it an
                            impossibility, looking at a frame of government, to determine with
                            certainty whether a better could not be made? There is no government of
                            which you may not say, it produces good effects, and we have had
                            experience of it. Would it therefore be a right conclusion, let no bad
                            government ever be changed? May not experience go, and go with absolute
                            certainty, beyond the results of any particular machine? Suppose as
                            perfect a piece of machinery as any that has yet been in play, will it
                            be pronounced impossible for mechanical knowledge looking at this
                            machinery to say, exaggerate as you please the good effects which it
                            produces, there are other contrivances which would produce them in
                            greater abundance, and this which I now present to you is to an absolute
                            certainty one of that description. Would it be endurable to say, we have
                            had experience of the other machine; we have had none of yours. Would
                            not the intelligent contriver say, this is a mere perversion of the word
                            experience. Is there one single power in this machine of which the most
                            ample experience has not been had? Is there a single combination of
                            those powers in it, of which the experience has not been had? Add the
                            effect of one combination to another, and can you not tell the result?
                            If 100 men eat 70 lbs. of beef to dinner, cannot you tell what 1000 men
                            will eat? Or would it be necessary for you to make the experiment, and
                            would you deny in such a case that you had experience to guide you?—You
                            have had <emph>Experience</emph>; and the good of it is—you are never to
                            profit by that experience. To profit by experience, is to observe
                            defects and correct them. According to Burke, if you do observe defects,
                            you are to go on repeating them for ever! <note><emph>Ibid</emph>.,

                        <p>A favourite fallacy of Burke, as of most of the anti-reformers is—that
                            any change in the government, so as to make it true to its ends, instead
                            of being false to them, is the same thing as a proposal to dissolve all
                            the bonds of government, and leave society in confusion. They present to
                            you this alternative: Either keep to your present government; Or have
                            none at all. They make an assumption contrary to experience; and on that
                            they build their conclusion. It is established by the experience of the
                            human race in all ages and all countries, that nothing is so difficult
                            to be dissolved as government; that after it has been once established,
                            there is no instance of its having been dissolved, or any thing like
                            dissolved. A temporary retraction in some of its parts is all that
                            history gives us an instance of. This, then, is all that is ever to be
                            apprehended. The bonds of society are strong and vigorous. Let the idea
                            of anarchy then be always scouted.</p>

                                article: ‘<emph>the government shall be just, and the people
                                    obedient</emph>.’ Were it possible to command such a result, the
                                balance of powers would be altogether superfluous; but, to succeed
                                in putting good maxims in execution, it is necessary to combine
                                institutions in such a way that every one shall find his interest in
                                maintaining them. … Legislators […] fall into a kind of
                                self-deception, when they introduce patriotic sentiments as a

                                because a fortunate circumstance, or perhaps a strong willed person
                                puts them in possession of liberty, and they acquire the virtues

                            subsequent to the anniversary of the 14th of July in 1792, when La

                        <p>Madame de Stael says, that in the minority, it is always bad policy, to

                                consist only in the energy of conviction. What are the weak in
                                numbers, if they are also weak in judgement?” [F] This
                            sentiment is brought forth in condemnation of those who in order to
                            bring the assembly to save Louis XVI allowed he was guilty, but
                            proclaimed it worthy of the French nation to pardon him. “They
                                pretended that it was necessary to humour the reigning opinion, that
                                they might moderate it at a proper time. … In France, they always
                                capitulate to the majority, even when they wish to oppose it; and
                                this miserable trick assuredly diminishes their strength instead of
                                increasing it.” [F] <emph>Ib</emph>., 88—“Moderate

                                institutions of France. This similarity caused the destruction of
                                both. It is in the art of directing or of yielding to public opinion
                                at the proper moment, that the science of government consists in

                                inflexibility of the spirit of party, that these men, who defended
                                whatever there was of respectability in France, could not flatter
                                themselves with exciting any interest by their efforts. They
                                struggled, they fell, they perished, while public report, the
                                harbinger of future fame, made them no promise of any recompense.
                                Even the constitutional royalists were so lost to common sense, as
                                to desire the triumph of the terrorists, that they themselves might
                                thus be avenged upon the republicans. To no purpose were they aware,
                                that they too were proscribed by these terrorists; irritated pride
                                prevailed over every thing.” [F] <emph>Ib</emph>., ii, 126.

                            <emph>The Cry of Jacobinism</emph>. “The most potent spell which
                                Bonaparte employed for the establishment of his power was, as we
                                have said, the terror which the very name of Jacobinism inspired,
                                although every person capable of reflection was perfectly aware that
                                this plague could not revive in France. We willingly assume the air
                                of fearing subdued factions to justify general measures of rigour.
                                All who wish to favour the establishment of despotism are constantly
                                endeavouring to keep the crimes of demagogues strongly in our
                                recollection. It is a system of tactics which has little difficulty.
                                Accordingly, Bonaparte paralyzed every kind of resistance to his
                                will by these words: <emph>Would you have me deliver you up to the
                                    Jacobins</emph>? France bent before him, nor was there a man
                                bold enough to reply, <emph>We will combat both the Jacobins and
                                    you</emph>.” [F] Mad. de Stael, <emph>Rev.

                            <emph>The pretexts of despotism</emph>. “When he” (Bonaparte)
                                “employed them, he alleged as a pretext, sometimes reasons of
                                state, sometimes the urgency of the moment, sometimes the activity
                                of his adversaries, sometimes the necessity of maintaining
                                tranquillity. Such is the artillery of the phrases by which absolute
                                power is defended, for circumstances never have an end; and in
                                proportion as restraint by illegal measures is increased, the
                                disaffected become more numerous, which serves to justify the
                                necessity of new acts of injustice. The establishment of the rule of
                                law is always deferred untill to-morrow, a vicious circle of
                                reasoning which is always difficult to overcome; for liberty will
                                scarcely be permitted till that public spirit prevail which can
                                result only from the enjoyment of liberty.” [F]

                            “Those among the French who sought to resist the continually
                                increasing power of the First Consul, had to invoke liberty in order
                                to struggle against him with success. But at this word the
                                aristocrats and the enemies of the Revolution roared out against
                                Jacobinism, and thus promoted the tyranny, the blame for which they
                                have since wished to throw upon their adversaries.” [F]

                        <p>The worshippers of power as it is would equally praise that of
                            Robespierre, or that of Bonaparte. All power is good, provided they are
                            its high priests, and have the power of damning to hell, all who dispute
                            the propriety of the worship.</p>
                        <p><emph>Legitimacy</emph>. “When the return of the Bourbons was
                                determined on by the allied powers, M. de Talleyrand brought forward
                                the principle of legitimacy, to serve as a rallying point to the new
                                spirit of party that was about to prevail in France. … Nothing is
                                more distressing in a time of crisis than those words of command,
                                which prevent most men from exercising their reasoning powers. Had
                                the revolutionists proclaimed not mere equality, but equality in the
                                eye of the law, this qualification would have been sufficient to
                                excite some reflection in the public mind. The case would be the
                                same with legitimacy, if we add to it the necessity of limiting the
                                royal power. But either of these words, equality or legitimacy, when
                                used without qualification, are only such as would justify a
                                sentinel who should fire on him that did not instantly give the
                                watch-word, on the demand ‘who goes there.’” [F] Mad. de

                                form of government rather than another. … What Frenchman is
                                prevented from passing his life as he pleases? … When I say, that
                                all governments are alike, I consider that in no government power
                                can be abused long. Mankind will not bear it. If a sovereign
                                oppresses his people to a great degree, they will rise and cut off
                                his head. There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny, that
                                will keep us safe under every form of government. Had not the people

                                of both of them were barbarians. The mass of every people must be
                                barbarous where there is no printing, and consequently knowledge is
                                not generally diffused. Knowledge is diffused among our people by
                                the newspapers.’ Sir Adam mentioned the orators, poets, and artists
                                of Greece. <emph>Johnson</emph>. ‘Sir, I am talking of the mass of
                                the people. We see even what the boasted Athenians were. The little
                                effect which Demosthenes’s orations had upon them shews that they

                        <p><emph>Vague Fears</emph>. Dr. Johnson, in his argument in favour of the
                            minister of Dumfermline, who had attacked a man from the pulpit, says,
                                “It may easily be urged, if a minister be thus left at
                                liberty to delate sinners from the pulpit, and to publish at will
                                the crimes of a parishioner, he may often blast the innocent, and
                                distress the timorous. He may be suspicious, and condemn without
                                evidence; he may be rash, and judge without examination; he may be
                                severe, and treat slight offences with too much harshness; he may be
                                malignant and partial, and gratify his private interest or
                                resentment under the shelter of his pastoral character.—Of all this
                                there is possibility, and of all this there is danger. But if
                                possibility of evil be to exclude good, no good ever can be done. If
                                nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger, we must all
                                sink into hopeless inactivity. … Power, in whatever hands it is
                                placed, will be sometimes improperly exerted; yet courts of law must
                                judge, though they will sometimes judge amiss.”

                            <emph>French Revolution</emph>. “Foreigners, and the rising
                                generation too young to have known their country before the
                                revolution, who form their estimate from the present condition of
                                the people, enriched as they are by the division of large estates,
                                and the suppression of the tithes and feudal burdens, can have no
                                idea of the situation of the country when the nation bore all the
                                burdens resulting from privilege and inequality. The advocates of
                                colonial slavery have often asserted that a French peasant was more
                                to be pitied than a negro—an argument this for relieving the whites,
                                but not for hardening the heart against the blacks. A state of
                                misery is productive of ignorance, and ignorance aggravates
                                misery—if we are asked why the French people acted with such cruelty
                                in the revolution, the answer will at once be found in their unhappy
                                state, and in that want of moral feeling which is its result.—It has
                                been in vain attempted, during the last twenty-five years, to
                                produce scenes in Switzerland, or Holland, similar to those which
                                have occurred in France; the good sense of these people, formed by
                                the long enjoyment of liberty, prevented every thing of the
                                kind.” [F] Mad. de Stael, <emph>Revol. Franç</emph>., tome

                                versed in business, and, above all very knowing in the disposition
                                of the times in which he lived. This man came secretly to the king,
                                and entertained him with the following discourse.—“I perceive, Sir,
                                you are very much cast down with the bounds that have been set to
                                your authority, but perhaps you have not lost so much as you
                                imagine. The people are very proud of their own work, and look with
                                great satisfaction on the outside of their new-created government;
                                but those who can see the inside too, find every thing too rotten
                                and superficial to last long. … Dependence will soon put an end to
                                this dream of liberty. Have you a mind to fix your power on a sure
                                and lasting basis? Fix it on the vices of mankind: Set up private
                                interest against public: apply to the wants, and vanities of
                                particulars: Shew those who lead the people, that they may better
                                find their account in betraying than defending them. This, Sir, is a
                                short plan of such a conduct as would make you really superior to
                                all restraint, without breaking in upon those <emph>nominal</emph>
                                securities, which the Troglodytes are more attached to a great deal
                                than they are to the things themselves. If you please to trust the
                                management to me, I shall not be afraid of being obnoxious to the

                                by individuals, only by a constant practice of justice, and frequent
                                exertion of superior wisdom. When any man finds his friend
                                oppressive and malicious, he naturally withdraws his affections from
                                him; when he observes him advancing absurd opinions, and adhering to
                                them with obstinacy incapable of conviction, he falls unavoidably
                                into a distrust of his understanding, and no longer pays any

                                constitution, and that which has taken place since the expulsion of
                                the Stuarts, is this, that the first was less perfect, but better
                                secured because the nobility and people had the sword in their
                                hands; whereas the latter is more regular, subject to fewer
                                disorders, and in the frame of it more free, but ill secured, the
                                sword being only in the hands of the King:—to which is added a vast
                                increase of the wealth of the crown, and a mighty influence gained
                                to it by the debts of the public, which have brought on new taxes,
                                new powers for the raising those taxes of a very dangerous nature,
                                and a prodigious multiplication of officers wholly dependent upon
                                the court; from all which the court has acquired new means of
                                corruption, without any new effectual securities against that
                                corruption being yet gained on the side of the people. And this sort
                                of power is so much more to be feared than any other, as it cannot
                                be exercised without depraving the morals, and debasing the spirit
                                of the whole people; which in the end would not only enslave them,
                                but render their servitude voluntary, deserved, and

                                reigns, when parliaments were laid aside for any length of time, the
                                whole authority of the state was lodged in a privy council, by the
                                advice and direction of which all affairs were carried on. But these
                                counsellors, being chosen by the king, and depending on his favour,
                                were too apt to advise such things only as they knew would be most
                                agreeable; and thus the interest of the nation were often sacrificed
                                to the profit and expectations of a few particulars. Yet still, as,
                                on extraordinary occasions, the King might be forced to call a
                                parliament, the fear of it was some check to their proceedings; and
                                a degree of caution was natural to men who foresaw they should
                                sooner or later be called to an account. But let us suppose that any
                                future prince could wholly influence the election of a parliament,
                                and make the members of it dependent on himself, what would be the
                                difference between that parliament and a privy council? Would it
                                speak the sense of the nation, or of the court? Would the interest
                                of the people be considered in it, or that of their representatives?
                                They would only differ in this respect, that one, having no power
                                above it, might be absolutely free from all restraint, which with

                            <emph>A radical reform of parliament would destroy King and House of
                                Lords</emph>. It appears to me, that this is not a very prudent
                            objection, for it really implies that between the existence of good
                            government, and the existence of a king and House of Lords, there is an
                            absolute incompatibility. The object that is aimed at by parliamentary
                            reform is good government: adequate security that the powers of
                            government shall be exercised for the good of the community in general;
                            not for the advantage of any small number, at the cost, and to the
                            oppression and degradation of <del>all the rest</del> the great body.
                            When this object is gained nothing more is required. To say that we
                            cannot obtain this object without destroying the institutions of king
                            and lords, what is this but [to] constitute oneself the most tremendous
                            enemy of the institutions of king and lords? This is to represent them
                            as institutions in the highest degree mischievous: as institutions
                            standing directly opposed to the welfare and happiness of human beings,
                            to the best interests of human nature. According to this representation,
                            they are institutions with which the interests of the great body of the
                            community can never be reconciled. But even according to Mr. Burke,
                                “A constitution against the interest of the many is rather of
                                the nature of a grievance than a law: that of all grievances it is
                                the most weighty and important.” (<emph>Tracts on the Popery
                                Laws</emph>, V, 259. Ed 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>)—But to go farther
                            into this question: What hinders the House of Commons from overturning
                            king and lords now, and taking all power into their own hands? You say,
                            it is because the king influences them: because a large proportion of
                            them are under the influence of peers. Are those who are so influenced a
                            majority, or not a majority? If they are not a majority, why does not
                            the majority outvote them? If they are not willing; neither would they
                            be so, if the minority were as little influenced as they are. If those
                            under influence are a majority, then the House of Commons is no
                            representative of the people. Let them take the argument which way they
                            will. Nay we may let them put the whole question on any foundation they
                            chuse. Let them determine, as they like best, whether we shall assume
                            that the two institutions in question are essential to good government,
                            or not. If they are not essential, where would be the harm in parting
                            with them? If they are essential, why should a reformed parliament may
                                [<emph>sic</emph>] be expected to do this mischief, more than any
                            other mischief? Oh, they would desire power. No doubt they would. But
                            the very object of reforming the parliament is to take effectual
                            securities against its being allowed to have undue power. <note>Burke,

                                succession.—Such, my lords, is the art of government discovered by
                                the wonderful sagacity of modern statesmen; who have found out, that
                                it is easier to palliate than to cure; and that the people may be
                                quieted by political soporifics, while diseases are preying upon
                                them, while their strength decays, and their vitals are
                                consumed.—That these falsehoods prevail upon mankind, and that,
                                after the discovery of one cheat, another equally gross is patiently
                                borne, cannot but raise the wonder of a man who views the world at a
                                distance, and who has not opportunities of inquiring into the
                                various motives of action or belief. Such an one would be inclined
                                to think us a nation of fools, that must be stilled with rattles, or
                                amused with baubles, and would readily conclude that our ministers
                                were obliged to practice such fallacies, because they could not
                                prevail upon us by motives adapted to reasonable beings.—But if we
                                reflect, my lords, upon the different principles upon which reports
                                like these are propagated and opposed, it will easily be discovered
                                that their success is not to be imputed either to superior art on
                                one side, or uncommon weakness on the other. It is well known that
                                they are promoted by men hired for that purpose with large salaries,
                                or beneficial employments, and that they can be opposed only from a
                                desire of detecting falsehood, and advancing the public happiness.
                                It is apparent, that those who invent, those who circulate, and
                                perhaps part of those who counterfeit belief of them, are incited by
                                the prospect of private advantage and immediate profit; and that
                                those who stop them in their career by contradictions and objections
                                can propose no other benefit to themselves, than that which they
                                shall receive in common with every other member of the community;
                                and therefore whoever has sufficiently observed mankind, to discover
                                the reason for which self-interest has in almost all ages prevailed
                                over public spirit, will be able to see why reports like these are

                                “There is yet one other consideration, my young brethren,
                                which I would wish to represent to you, and which it is of the
                                deepest consequence you should, in the present hours, impress upon
                                your minds. The time we live in is itself eloquent. The ages are
                                past, in which power can constitute right, or wealth embellish
                                corruption,—in which authority can take the place of virtue, or the
                                honours of distinction be maintained amid the profligacies of
                                individual character. … The progress of national prosperity,—the
                                searching inquiries of science,—above all, the diffusion of the
                                spirit of the gospel, have broken the spell which formerly rendered
                                the great invulnerable. … Let me entreat you to look at the fall of
                                another country,—to that mighty ruin which now covers the first of
                                European monarchies, and which has buried every thing that, but a
                                few years ago, was noble or elevated, in one promiscuous grave.
                                Alas! while you look upon this sepulchre of human greatness, is
                                there not a voice which arises from the tomb, and which seems to
                                tell you also to beware;—which tells you … that the fabric of
                                society itself can only be maintained by the progressive improvement
                                of every rank in knowledge and in virtue. It is the melancholy truth
                                of history, that the corruption of every people has begun with the
                                great; and if ever that dread day shall come, when this constitution
                                … shall also perish, it will be when the higher orders are more
                                corrupt than the lower;—when, in the security of vanity, or in the
                                baseness of vicious pleasure, they shall at once have undermined the
                                respect of the vulgar, the confidence of the wise, and the hope of

                                constitution which, if not free, is worse than useless. … The House
                                of Commons is not by its complexion peculiarly subject to the
                                distempers of an independent habit. … It required a great length of
                                time, very considerable industry and perseverance, no vulgar policy,
                                the union of many men, and many tempers, and the concurrence of
                                events which do not happen every day, to build up an independent
                                House of Commons. … The late House of Commons has been punished for
                                its independence. That example is made. Have we an example, on
                                record, of an House of Commons punished for its servility? The
                                rewards of a senate so disposed are manifest to the world. … If
                                these examples take root in the minds of men, what members hereafter
                                will be bold enough not to be corrupt? Especially as the king’s
                                high-way of obsequiousness is so very broad and easy. To make a
                                passive member of parliament, no dignity of mind, no principles of
                                honour, no resolution, no ability, no industry, no learning, no
                                experience are in the least degree necessary. … The present
                                surrender, … and the resolution to support any minister, …
                                determines not only on all the power and authority of the House, but
                                it settles the character and description of the men who are to
                                compose it; and perpetuates that character as long as it may be
                                thought expedient to keep up a phantom of popular representation. …
                                An extravagant spirit of independency, with which the late House of
                                Commons were charged, is a species of offence so closely connected

                                commanded. To have commandment over beasts, as herdsmen have, is a

                                schoolmasters have, is a matter of small honour; to have commandment
                                over galley slaves is a disparagement, rather than an honour.
                                Neither is the commandment of tyrants much better over people which
                                have put off the generosity of their minds: and therefore it was
                                ever holden, that honours in free monarchies and commonwealths had a
                                sweetness more than in tyrannies, because the commandment extendeth
                                more over the wills of men. And therefore when Virgil putteth

                            these epithets belong to my opinions, rather than to yours? Is a thing
                            wise, merely because you think so? Is a thing, wild, visionary, frantic,
                            merely because I think so? Have we this prodigious difference between
                            us? No, I am far from holding any thing to be wise, because I think so,
                            or wild because you think it. But I hold that frantic which you think,
                            because almost every body thinks so. To be thought by the majority—this
                            then, according to you, is that which makes true and false, wise and
                            foolish. This opinion, however, wants some clearing up. Do not people’s
                            opinions sometimes change? Cannot you point out many things which almost
                            every body thought about first in one way, and afterwards came to think
                            about, in a way directly reverse. Was the first thought true, as long as
                            they held it, and the opposite false; and did it become false, and

                        <p>opposite true, the moment, they adopted the change?—No, Sir, that is not
                            what I mean.—You do not then hold that any man’s thinking any thing to
                            be true, makes it, though false before, to be then true? And if one
                            man’s opinion cannot do so, neither will you suppose that another man’s
                            opinion added to his, nor the opinion of any number of men however
                            great.—No, Sir, but the soundness of my opinion is confirmed by its
                            conformity to existing practice, the wildness of yours by its departure
                            from it.—Sir, I am so far from agreeing to your conclusion, that I know
                            nothing in the whole store-house of opinions so perfectly wild and
                            visionary as yours. I undertake to prove that nothing is more
                            conformable to experience than mine. Was ever any thing more absurd,
                            more foreign to all just observation than the miserable supposition that
                            you can hold for ever the same any one position of human affairs; that
                            you can secure from change any system of human institutions? Is any one
                            generation the same, or made the same with any preceding generation? Is
                            ever any generation in the same circumstances with any other? If not;
                            then fix upon any generation, you please, to which you may affirm that
                            your institutions were exactly adapted. That it was adapted to any other
                            generation is a perfect proof, that it stands in need of change to adapt
                            it to the present. Your opinions, therefore, which are at variance with
                            all experience are in the only proper sense, wild and visionary. My
                            opinions which are only these, that if those persons whose affairs are
                            managed have not an adequate controul over those who do manage, they are
                            sure to be managed ill; and that the people of England are fit to be
                            trusted with the choice of those, who are to manage for them, are on the
                            other hand capable of being proved by the most decisive results of
                            experience.</p>

                                whole order and tenour of our constitution.—Parliament is not a

                                resulting from the general reason of the whole. … If the local
                                constituent should have an interest, or should form an hasty
                                opinion, evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the

                        <p>If power be the inseparable companion of wealth, the progress of taxation
                            is favourable to oligarchy; because excessive taxation plunders the many
                            to enrich the few; it has a tendency to accumulate wealth in a few
                            hands. Excessive taxation, which cannot be taken from the labourers, and
                            must, the greater part of it, be taken from profits, retards the
                            increase of capital, and keeps down the accumulation of wealth among the
                            middle classes. In as far as taxes are taken from rents, they are
                            naturally taken in a greater proportion from the small rents, than from
                            the great ones; and they are taken from all the receivers of rents, to
                            be paid back, a great proportion of them, to the receivers of the great
                            rents, in the shape of sinecures, pensions, perquisites, and salaries of
                            over-paid places. All excessive taxation, therefore, beside the
                            influence which it creates, favours that distribution of property which
                            leads to oligarchical power.</p>

                                    one cannot study mathematics without being led to the truth. …

                                principle can be nothing but the dominion exercised over our minds

                                called their justice and necessity; the other is, that the

                                guardians of the laws belongs only to the Magistrates exclusively:
                                the first, the true depository and general guardian of the laws is
                                the nation itself, at the head of which is the sovereign. Speaking
                                rigorously, the depository and guardian of the laws can belong only
                                to those who are armed with the superiority of the physical power in
                                order to procure to that depository the security of which it
                                essentially has need. That given, it is the nation as a whole which
                                is naturally and necessarily the depository and guardian of its own
                                laws. … Because we cannot agree on this point without great debates
                                which give rise to all sorts of pretensions, but it is easy to
                                terminate these debates by saying: It is physically and socially
                                impossible that the security of the laws would have another
                                principle than the evidence of their justice and of their necessity.
                                … The depositories and the natural guardians of the laws are
                                therefore all those who are called to possess that evidence: Thus
                                the sovereign who ought always to take it for his guide […] thus the
                                nation who I suppose to be enlightened by the public evidence of the
                                essential order of societies, etc., are their depository.”

                            of potent checks. “When cheats are once found out, he thought

                                would be no reason to expect honest dealing: For men are not honest

                                all. It is that in which all the rights of men are preserved; since
                                that of exercising legislative power, either by himself, or by his
                                representatives, is one of those rights. M. Turgot often said, ‘I
                                have never known a truly republican constitution, that is, a country
                                where persons of property had an equal right to concur in the
                                formation of laws, to regulate the constitution of the assemblies
                                which digest and promulgate those laws, and to alter by a regular
                                deliberation the form of every public institution. Wherever these
                                rights do not exist, in a legal manner, it is not a republic, but an
                                aristocracy more or less corrupt, to which we improperly give the
                                name of republic.’”

                                “But it will be said that the French, during the Revolution,
                                incessantly wandered between folly and crime. If it was so, this
                                must be attributed, I cannot too often repeat, to their former
                                political institutions; for if they were of a nature to enlighten
                                only one class of men, and deprave the mass they were certainly good
                                for nothing. But the sophistry of the enemies of human reason lies
                                in their requiring that a people should possess the virtues of
                                liberty before they obtain liberty; while it cannot acquire those
                                virtues till after having enjoyed liberty; since the effect cannot
                                precede the cause. The first quality of a nation that begins to be
                                weary of exclusive and arbitrary governments is energy. Other
                                virtues can be only the gradual result of institutions which have

                                is. The virtue therefore of every being <del>is constituted

                                having come to exist in that <del>subject. Makes such? (each?) of

                                good? To me this appears to be the case. A mind, therefore,
                                    <del>which possesses its own</del> possessing that order which
                                properly belongs to mind, is better than a mind in disorder. Of
                                necessity. But that which possesses order, is orderly. It must be
                                so. And that which is orderly <del>must</del> is

                                temperate mind, therefore, is good. I, O <del>good</del> Kallicles,

                                intemperate, and the unchastised were the same. Now the temperate
                                    <del>mind</del> is a mind calculated for doing what is proper in

                                eradicate those seeds of discord and dissention which have been
                                suffered to grow up amongst us. It is to be feared, that too much
                                prejudice may remain, with respect to this question; and that it is
                                not felt to be as liberal and just as our interest and safety
                                require that it should be felt in this country. But you will concur
                                with me, in thinking, that it is above all things necessary for us
                                to apply ourselves to that great work of union; to remove those
                                disabilities, equally improvident and unjust, which exclude so large
                                a portion of the empire from the full enjoyment of the blessings of
                                the constitution.” Earl Grey’s speech at the Fox dinner at
                            Newcastle, published in the <emph>Morning Chronicle</emph>, 6<hi
                                rend="sup">th</hi> Jan. 1819. Having cast my eye upon this passage,
                            about the middle of the speech, before I had read any more, I concluded
                            it related to Parliamentary Reform; as that great measure, which would
                                “eradicate the seeds of discord and dissention, which have
                                been suffered to grow up” among the great body of the
                            British people. It was true, I thought, “that too much prejudice
                                remained concerning that question; and that it is not felt to be as
                                liberal and just, as our interest and safety require that it should
                                be felt in this country.” And I was perfectly ready to
                            concur with the speaker in thinking, “that it is above all things
                                necessary for us to apply ourselves to that great work of
                                union;” as I was perfectly persuaded that this union could
                            only be effected, as he declared, by “removing those
                                disabilities, equally improvident and unjust, which exclude so large
                                a portion of the empire from the full enjoyment of the blessings of
                                the constitution;” namely all those who are deprived of the
                            election franchise, and have no controul over those by whom the powers
                            of the constitution are wielded. After having indulged for a few seconds

                            a few lines higher up, I perceived it was the catholic emancipation he
                            all the time was speaking of; when I perceived also, that after saying
                            he was a friend to reform, he proceeded afterwards to prove that he was
                            no friend to it! And yet, not one argument did he produce to shew that
                            his catholic emancipation would do good, which does not shew that reform
                            would do more of the same good. If the disaffection of the Irish people
                            is a bad thing—surely the disaffection of the British people is a worse
                            thing. If <del>the union of</del> concord with the Irish people is a
                            good thing, that with the British people is a better. If the Irish
                            people are excluded from the benefits of the constitution, because they
                            are prevented by the absence of certain religious qualifications, from
                            being elected members of parliament; the people of Great Britain, are in
                            a still higher sense excluded from the benefits of the constitution,
                            because they are prevented by the absence of certain pecuniary
                            qualifications from voting for a member of parliament, or having any
                            legal <del>share</del> power whatsoever over the management of their own
                            concerns. If it be said, that there would be danger in the absence of
                            the pecuniary qualifications, in giving a share to the benefits of the
                            constitution; it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> said, and with still more

                            chusing the representatives were good, the representatives themselves
                            would be good. Observe the language of the Whigs. Go into the detail of
                            it. Quote their speeches in chronological order. You will find that
                            every parliament, during which they have been kept out of place; which,
                            in other words, has supported their opponents, the men whom they have
                            arraigned, is stigmatized and reproached by them, as a wicked
                            parliament, bold to commit iniquity. Now this has been every parliament
                            with little exception, since the beginning of the present reign. This is
                            a tolerable experience. During all this time the parliament has been
                            bad. What has made it so? If there have been causes to make it bad so
                            long, what new cause is there to make it better now?</p>
                        <p><emph>Le Present est Gros de l’Avenir</emph>: a Phrase of Leibnitz: it is
                            the same idea to say, that the present is the birth or child of the
                            past. Apply this to the French Revolution. Was that an abominable time?
                            What was its parent? The time that preceded. Are effects correspondent
                            to their cause? Then, the time that preceded was an abominable
                                <del>cause</del> time. Whatever qualities exist in the effect, must
                            they not all exist in a still greater degree in the cause? No body can
                            communicate any thing to another body, which it has not itself; heat, if
                            it has not heat; motion, if it has not motion: and it never can
                            communicate more of any thing than it has itself; never perhaps so much,
                            because it cannot strip itself of all that it has. If, then, the French
                            revolution derived all its qualities from the time that preceded, the
                            time that preceded must have had a greater aggregate of badness, than
                            that time. The French revolution, then, however bad, was an amendment
                            upon the past. It is therefore not to be regretted. <note>Leibniz

                                ago resigned his employment of secretary of state, because he would
                                not submit to be a cypher in his office, and work under a man who
                                had not an hundredth part of his knowledge and understanding,
                                resolved to meddle no more in popular affairs. However he was lately
                                so much disgusted with our bad measures, that he could not help
                                animadverting on them, though in his usual calm and polite manner.
                                His petition to the king is an excellent satire, and hath discovered
                                to the whole nation how, at a time when we are oppressed with taxes,
                                and the common people every where grown mutinous for want of bread,
                                the public money is squandered away in pensions, generally bestowed

                                annually to one great lord to support his luxury, and to another to
                                gratify his avarice. I am well assured that the present D. of D. has
                                received more than £200,000 in places and pensions since the

                        <p><emph>Corruption of the Government</emph>—asserted, and truly—but
                            ascribed to a wrong cause: Walpole, as affirmed by Hume
                                [<emph>sic</emph> King], could not have continued to act wickedly as
                            a minister, unless the government was bad which suffered him. “It
                                is <hi rend="bold">certain</hi>, that all our national misfortunes,
                                since the accession of the House of Hanover, must be chiefly
                                ascribed to Walpole’s administration. He unhinged all the principles
                                and morals of our people, and changed the government into a system
                                of corruption. He openly ridiculed virtue and merit, and promoted no
                                man to any employment of profit or honour, who had scruples of
                                conscience, or refused implicitly to obey his commands. He was a
                                ready speaker, understood the business of parliament, and knew how
                                to manage an house of commons, which, however, was not a very
                                difficult task, if it be considered that a majority of the members
                                were of his own nomination.”

                            Government</emph>—placed on satisfactory evidence. “Mr. W.
                                Levison[-Gower], my Lord Gower’s brother, told me, that he happened
                                to be in the House of Lords, and standing next Sir Robert Walpole,
                                when there was a warm debate concerning some ministerial measures.
                                In the midst of the debate, says Sir Robert to him ‘You see with
                                what zeal and vehemence these gentlemen oppose, and yet I know the
                                price of every man in this house, except three, and your brother is
                                one of them.’ Sir Robert was frequently very unguarded in his
                                expressions: for nothing certainly could have been thrown out more
                                injurious to the honour of the House of Lords. Besides this was an
                                open confession of his manner of government, and to what a great
                                height he had carried corruption.”

                                In c. 15 he remarks: “The most delicate occasion for a
                                    statesman or king is when a state that has been badly governed
                                    for several reigns seems to have no plan or even principles. So
                                    abuses arise in abundance, and the longer one waits to remedy
                                    them, the more obstacles there are to overcome. To create a
                                    system in this case, one should not look to one’s imagination
                                    for the most perfect government. One would merely create a piece
                                    of fiction. One must study the character of the people, search
                                    out the usages and customs, and identify the abuses. Then one
                                    will preserve what was found to be good and replace what was
                                    found bad, but this will be in the ways more consistent with the
                                    citizen’s mores. If the statesman offends them, this should
                                    merely be on the occasion in which he has enough authority to
                                    forestall the unfortunate natural consequences of sudden
                                    revolutions. Often he will not attempt to remove an abuse
                                    brusquely. He will appear to tolerate it and attack it only in a
                                    devious way. In short he will create such a sound combination of
                                    the changes with everything to be preserved, and with the power
                                    that he enjoys, that they will take place imperceptibly or at
                                    least with the approbation of some of the citizenry and without
                                    any fear on the part of its opponents. Those who do not bring
                                    all this circumspection to governmental reform run the risk of
                                    precipitating the destruction of the state.” In c. 16 he
                                comments: “There is another important difference between the
                                    principles of physics and those of politics. Physical principles
                                    are facts that experience does not permit us to doubt; political
                                    principles do not always have this advantage. Often the
                                    complexity of circumstances and the need to make quick decisions
                                    constrain the statesman to base his plans on the merely
                                    probable. Obliged to foresee or get ready for the future, he
                                    cannot have the same information as the physicist who reasons
                                    only about what he can see. Physics can erect systems only in
                                    particular cases; politics must have universal views and take in
                                    all aspects of government. In physics we cannot overthrow bad
                                    principles too completely, there are no precautionary measures
                                    to be taken, and we ought always to grasp unhesitatingly the
                                    measures provided by observation. In politics, we conform to
                                    circumstances and cannot always suddenly reject a faulty
                                    established system; we take measures, and we make only slow
                                    progress toward a more perfect system.”</note></p>

                            language of mankind is on his side. For as often as injustice appears in
                            its most pure and perfect form, it is not blamed, but the object of
                            praise and admiration: the injustice, for example, of the great injurer,
                            the hero and the despot, the men who trample on the rights of others
                            without fear. But what is the difference between them and the miserable

                                inconsistent; but Mad. de Stael approves the results and with a
                                stroke of the brush she delivers a warrant of banishment to those
                                who are in the grip of these difficult circumstances. It is a
                                convenient role: one accepts the results of the events because they
                                are happy; one blames the event because it is accompanied so often
                                by regrettable circumstances which are inevitable: thus one pays
                                honour to her reason and to her sensibility at the same time. It is
                                a reckoning where all is profit: also I see many brave gentlemen who
                                do this and find that it works well for them. One cries with those
                                who complain; one rejoices with those who approve; one has not had,
                                in all this series of events one idea that is false; there has not
                                been one stupidity that one can prove; one is not permitted even one
                                equivocal action for which one may be blamed; in consequence one
                                ought to be very well contented with oneself and one may even praise
                                oneself.” [F] <emph>Examen Critique de l’Ouvrage Posth. de

                            corruption of the electors produces mischief, only in proportion as it
                            produces corruption in the elected. As often as the elector may be
                            corrupt, but the elected not, the corruption of the elector produces no
                            harm. By the moral test, the corruption of the elector is venial
                            compared with that of the member. A portion of influence is mischievous
                            in proportion as it is calculated to produce mischievous acts. The
                            degree in which it is so calculated, that is the degree of its
                            mischievousness, is a proportion to the <del>necessity</del> certainty
                            with which it must produce mischievous acts; and the <del>number of

                            produce. Now the certainty is much less in the case of the elector. The
                            number depends more upon the shape of the matter of corruption, as well
                            as the situation of the party corrupted: where the matter of corruption
                            operates only to a single act, as a piece of money for a single vote:
                            where it operates to a series of corrupt acts; as a place held during
                            pleasures; or the prospect of a place, or of a better place. The
                            dependent is placed in the most mischievous of all situations, where his
                            situation constitutes a motive to make him constantly on the look out to

                                the Popish clergy, but with the same ill success, which hath always
                                attended every proposal for reformation, addressed to that order of
                                men. To abandon usurped power, to renounce lucrative error, are
                                sacrifices which the virtue of <hi rend="underline">individuals</hi>
                                has, on some occasions, offered to truth; but from any society of
                                men, no such effort can be expected. The corruptions of a society,
                                recommended by common utility, and justified by universal practice,
                                are viewed by its members, without shame or horror; and reformation
                                never proceeds from themselves, but is always forced upon them by
                                some foreign hand. Suitable to this unfeeling and inflexible spirit,
                                was the behaviour of the convocation in the present conjuncture. All
                                the demands of the protestants were rejected with contempt; and the
                                Popish clergy, far from endeavouring, by any prudent concessions, to
                                sooth and to reconcile such a numerous body, asserted the doctrines
                                of their church, concerning some of the most exceptionable articles,
                                with an ill-timed rigour, which gave new offence.”

                                the right of property. … All possess something, and they have need
                                of preserving it. When they are owners only of their person, of
                                their labour and of the salary from that labour, they will have a
                                great interest in seeing that property is respected. … That is so
                                true of the right of property that even the pickpocket, whom one
                                punishes for having violated it, if he is not cut off completely
                                from society, has an interest in seeing that this right be
                                respected. For the day after the day he suffers that punishment, he
                                would not be able to be certain of anything of what will remain to
                                him if his property were not protected.” [F] Destutt-Tracy,
                                <emph>Ideologie</emph>, (Econ. Polit.) v. IV, p. 293.—“We
                                have already seen that the poor are also as interested in the
                                maintenance of the right of property as the most opulent; for the
                                little that he possesses is all for him, and by consequence
                                infinitely precious to his eyes, and he is certain of anything only
                                as much as property is respected. He has even yet another reason for
                                wanting it, it is the stock on which he lives, the sum of capital of
                                those who employ him, is considerably diminished when property is
                                not secure. Also, he has a direct interest not only in the
                                conservation of what he possesses, but also in the conservation of
                                what others possess. Also, in spite of all the dreadful effects of
                                poverty, of bad education, of bad manners and of the resentment of
                                injustice, it is perhaps true to say that it is in this class which
                                commits the most crimes (Even that is very doubtful, if one has
                                regard to the difference of the number of individuals), it is
                                nevertheless true also that it is in that class that one finds the
                                highest idea of the rights of property, and that the name of thief
                                is the most odious. But when you speak of property, include under
                                this name, as the poor do, personal property as well as chattels and
                                landed estates. The first is even yet more sacred, since it is the
                                source of the others. Respect it in him as you would wish that he
                                respects in you that which is derived from it. Leave to him the free
                                disposition of his powers and their employment, as you wish that he
                                leaves to you that of your real estate and your capital. That rule
                                is as shrewd as it is just, and as badly observed.” [F]

                            a bad state of society; that is, any state in which it has ever yet been
                            seen; and the advancement, or even existence of philosophy, is well
                            displayed by Plato, in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of the
                                <emph>Republic</emph>, where after saying that government then only
                            would be good, when either philosophers were kings, or the kings
                            philosophers, he answers the objection, that if experience was to be
                            guide, not speculation, the philosophers were a tribe, useless, not only
                            for governing, but any other office in life. The objection, Socrates
                            says, is a good one. But it is necessary to examine the causes of its
                            being good. The causes why the objection is sound may be all summed up
                            in one—the state of society. But the state of society does two things.
                            1. It makes those who are really philosophers, if the miracle should
                            occur of their [<emph>sic</emph> there] being any such, not to be
                            recognized for good, but to <del>be hunted down, as not tending</del>
                            treated with all sorts of evil as bad, because it is not for the
                            interest of those in power that they should be known for what they are.
                            2. It turns away from the study of philosophy—more especially the
                            aspiring and gifted natures, who would make the greatest progress, by
                            its distribution of rewards and punishments—by the mode in which it
                            distributes power, and riches, and fame, etc. NB There is a striking
                            passage at the close of this explanation, in which the author says, that
                            a philosopher, even when he happens, by some new concurrence of
                            circumstances, to exist, dares not to deliver the truths which he knows.

                        <p><emph>People’s Power</emph>. Burke says somewhere, that the people have a
                            right, an indefeasible right to all the power which they are capable of
                            exercising without injury to themselves.—The evidence of this may be
                            seen in the ideas involved in the very term community. A community, any
                            community, great or small, have [<emph>sic</emph> has] a joint right to
                            the management of what belongs to them all in common. Whatever they can
                            transact in common, they have a right to transact. Matters of detail
                            they can not transact, nor matters which depend on much deliberation.
                            But one thing they can all do in common; which is to chuse persons to do
                            for them, what they cannot do for themselves. Now according to Burke’s
                            dogma as many of the people ought to share in this power as can possibly
                            share in it without injury to the object for which the choice is made.
                            No species of men ought to be excluded except for specific reason
                            shewed. Upon those who propose any limitation lies the <emph>onus
                                probandi</emph>; the onus of proving that the admission of such
                            people to the power of chusing would be injurious to the people
                            themselves.—This much with regard to the extent of the suffrage. With
                            regard to the frequency of choice, Burke says again (Speech on Duration
                            of Parliaments, <emph>Works</emph>, 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>, vol. 5, p.
                            374). “The object in view is to have parliaments as frequent as
                                they can be, without distracting them in the prosecution of public
                                business.” That is to say, they should be annual; and for
                            this reason that they should not be interrupted during a session—but one
                            session is enough in a year; and there is no distraction in having an
                            election during the interval between one session and another.

                            for the few?—B. For both.—A. In one sense of the word, Sir, it must be
                            allowed, that you have spoken true. But I cannot but think you knew that
                            was not the sense of the words intended in my question.—B. Is not this a
                            sense which the words of your question will bear? Of several senses, by
                            what mark am I to know that which you mean? Ought not the precision of
                            your questions to exclude mistake?—A. It was for shortness, Sir, and to
                            save the time of myself and you, that I contented myself with an
                            expression, which I thought you would not misunderstand, and the meaning
                            of which you would not seek to elude.—But I see that the man who
                            converses with you, must allow <del>nothing for d. leave no door
                                open</del> leave nothing open. Come, then, Sir, I will try to make
                            my expression more precise. If government exists equall for the good
                            both of the many and the few; does it exist <hi rend="underline"

                            should it not, Sir? You do not answer my question. If you have any

                        <p>to know what it is.—I have no objection.—Then, Sir, do tell me whether
                            government is intended as much for the good of the many, as that of the
                            few?—I say, Sir, that it is; and let us see how you will refute me.
                            —Sir, you mistake me. I have no desire to refute you Sir, any more than
                            to refute myself. As it is natural for me to regard myself more than I
                            regard even you, I am much more anxious to find out if I myself am in
                            error, than to find out if you [are.] I am therefore desirous to inquire
                            into this opinion of yours, and to embrace it, if I find it to be right.
                            You say that government is equally intended for the good of the many and
                            the few. But what if the good of the one should oppose that of the
                            other? Which ought to give way? Sometimes, the one, Sir, I should say;
                            and sometimes the other.—According to some rule, Sir; or according to no
                            rule?—If I say according to some rule, Sir, you will ask what rule.—That
                            is likely, Sir, indeed.—Then Sir, I shall say, no rule.—If they ought to
                            give way according to no rule, they ought to give way just as it
                            happens.—Yes, Sir.—Every thing which happens, then, is just as it ought
                            to happen; and nothing happens wrong, every thing right.—It appears so
                            to follow, Sir.—You see also what follows besides, that no destruction
                            of the liberties and privileges of the many, at the will of the few; no
                            oppression, no misrule, of which an oligarchy, or monarchy can be
                            guilty, can ever be wrong.—This, Sir, is rather too much for me to
                            admit.—Pray, Sir, do not be faint-hearted. Let not trifles alarm you. It
                            is only the happiness of the many you are sacrificing; and as the woman
                            said of skinning the eels alive, they are used to it. However, if your
                            courage should not carry you so far, you must retract your assertion,
                            that the good of the many and the few, where opposed, ought to give way
                            to one another not according to any rule. And if you say they ought to
                            give way to one another according to some rule, you are bound to say
                            what rule.—I do not easily see, Sir, what rule can be assigned in this
                            case. Suppose we should go upon the levelling plan—deal even-handed—and
                            say that the greatest good on whatever side, should always prevail.

                            <emph>Contempt and disrepute</emph>. Mr. Serjeant Copley, in the debate
                            on the right of appeal in cases of murder, in the House of Commons on
                            Friday 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1819, said “Every thing
                                which had a tendency to bring the laws of the country into contempt
                                and disrepute ought certainly for that reason to be
                                removed.”—But nothing more surely exposes laws to contempt
                            and disrepute than their imperfections. Reform, then, is the best
                            possible thing for laws. NB The whole house assented to the opinion of
                            the learned serjeant. <note>Debate on the Trial by Battle Abolition

                            Nov. 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1819. “Mr. Justice Bayley proceeded
                                to pronounce the judgement of the court, and in so doing he
                                expatiated in very strong language upon the character of the offence
                                of which the defendants had been convicted. He said, their crime was
                                one of the greatest magnitude, and he confessed his own defect of
                                language to express the abhorrence in which such a crime ought to be
                                held by every man in the country. It was of the highest importance
                                to the public that the purity of election should be preserved. There
                                should be no inroad into the House of Commons by corrupt means; for
                                how could the country have any confidence in that house, if its
                                doors were open to corruption? Or how could the public be induced to
                                believe that persons who obtained seats by such means, would
                                themselves be free from being corrupted in that place.” This
                            is an excellent text to preach from. According to this judge, if a
                            majority of the commons were chosen by bribery, the public ought to have
                            no confidence in them. A majority of them are chosen by corrupt
                            influence, namely that of fear. The whole of this cant is disgusting to
                            the last degree. What is pretended is, that they wish to make the
                            election of members pure. What they know is, that practically speaking
                            this operation of theirs will be of none avail. What they further know
                            is, that they have it in their power to make it pure. Compare what they
                            do, with what they do not do; and then say what their conduct deserves.

                            <emph>Imputations</emph>. A man who wishes to improve the institutions
                            of his country is a man who hates his country. A man who points out to
                            notice the causes of evil, and advises his countrymen to remove them, is
                            a man who hates his king. The man who thinks that any thing in England
                            could be better than it is, has no English feeling. To him English
                            feeling is, in other words, to doat upon English deformities; to cherish
                            English evils; where England is bad, to keep her bad, where England
                            might receive improvement to keep her from improvement. To love England,
                            according to this language, is to be her greatest enemy. To have love
                            for the king is to do mischief to the people. To have loyalty, and to
                            have English feeling, is to be a worshipper of evil, under the stile and
                            title of things as they are. Again, to be a worshipper of the Devil
                            under the stile and title of things as they are, is to be a lover of
                            one’s country, of one’s king. To be a lover of one’s country and king,
                            is to be a hater of one’s countrymen. If to love one’s country, and
                            one’s king be a phrase which implies the acting as the enemy of one’s

                            seek the harm of the king and the constitution, you mean one of two
                            things—either that the good of the people is the ill of the king and the
                            constitution—or that reform is not for the good of the people. If they
                            say the last, we shall take the liberty of desiring you to prove it. For
                            the only way you have yet attempted to prove the badness of reform is by
                            traducing the reformers. But if you call any set of persons bad, we
                            shall expect you to prove it—because to impute to any body wickedness
                            without proving it is to be a—you know what. As the Jesuits did with
                            Pascal, so the conspiracy does with the reformers. The Jesuits said,
                            that to Pascal’s fifteen letters, the only answer necessary was, to
                            repeat fifteen times that he was a heretic. In like manner the
                            conspirators to the fifteen hundred unanswerable arguments for reform,
                            the only answer necessary is to repeat fifteen hundred times that the
                            reformers are anarchists. As the nick-name “heretic” would have been in
                            those days a sufficient answer among all those who believed in the
                            Jesuits, so the nick-name “anarchist” is a sufficient answer now among
                            all those who believe in the conspirators. <note>On Pascal see

                            <emph>The Constitution</emph>—This word has changed its meaning. It one
                            time, that is formerly, it was meant to signify those parts of the
                            established customs which afforded protection to the people against the
                            king. It is now used to signify those parts of the established customs,
                            called laws, which place and keep the powers of oppressing the people,
                            in the hands of the aristocratical few. The word constitution is so
                            vague, that when it is used by two men of opposite biases, it is used in
                            senses almost repugnant—by the one to signify the securities of the many
                                <del>people</del> against the few—by the other to signify the powers
                            legalized to the few of oppressing the many.</p>

                            <emph>Whig Reform</emph>. This sham, this delusion, this mock reform
                            gives a victorious handle to the enemy. When Canning says, All
                            innovation without improvement is pure mischief, It may be distinctly
                            proved that not one of the evils ascribed to the House of Commons would
                            be remedied by the whig reform. With regard to triennial parliaments
                            this was demonstratively proved by Burke. Mere trienniality would not
                            alter the composition, nor the interests. And it is perfectly clear that
                            householder suffrage without the ballot would not make the choice more
                            independent. To all this, I assent. <note>On Burke see <ref

                            the king. I am afraid it means much more truly hatred of the people;
                            that body which, including as it does the whole of the middle rank,
                            comprises almost all that is valuable in the population. Why do I infer
                            that it means hatred of the people? Because I scarcely ever hear it
                            celebrated unless in conjunction not only with abuse and defamation of
                            the people, but with the recommendation of measures for their
                                <del>ruin</del> destruction. Loyalty, standing as the name for a
                            system of principles, means, as I find almost always by the discourse of
                            those who use it, a set of principles, diametrically opposite to the
                            interest of the people: those principles, the object of which is to
                            legalize in the hands of the few, the power of doing what they please
                            with the many. If I am to interpret Loyalty by the use which is
                            generally made of it, I cannot, therefore, abstain from <del>abhorring
                                it</del> having a very bad opinion of it. I find it employed
                            insidiously and covertly to defame all those who venture to speak a word
                            in favour of the people. Persons of a certain description come forward
                            and make ostentation of their loyalty, with declaration[s] that all
                            those persons who do not <del>act and think</del> speak as they do, are
                            actuated by certain detestable designs; have nothing less in view than
                            the usurpation of all property, and the slaughter of all those who are
                            its owners. This has in it all the turpitude of a malignant slander; and
                            as nobody ever tries to blacken another, but for some selfish purpose;
                            to <del>retain some</del> secure some personal advantage, which cannot
                            be secured by other means, the cry of loyalty is one of the most mean,
                            as well as wicked of all atrocities. The ostentation of loyalty; and cry
                            of disloyalty, is like the ostentation of orthodoxy, and cry of heresy,
                            by which people were formerly burnt.</p>
                        <p><emph>Radicality</emph>. I should be glad to know what is meant by it. If
                            it is a bad thing, I am not for it. If it means such laws as are
                            calculated to secure the interests of the many against the encroachments
                            and usurpations of the few, I am a radical, and among the most ardent of
                            the sort. If it means the procuring of laws which may take the powers of
                            government out of the hands of those who with the power cannot but have
                            the will to use them in opposition to the ends of their institution; and
                            when they are taken out of such hands to place them in the hands of
                                <del>men</del> those who shall neither have the powers nor the will
                            to use in opposition to those ends, I can imagine nothing more congenial
                            to my soul than radicality. It appears to me, like heresy, to be the
                            road to salvation. I confess that my wish is to follow that course which
                            affords the best chance of placing the powers of government, <del>where
                                they will be best used</del> in the hands of the wisest and best.
                            These <del>aristocratical band</del> I am sure are not <del>of that
                                description</del> the aristocratical body, nor any part of it. A
                            very <del>feeble</del> low degree of understanding and virtue makes a
                            great shew in that region. “A wit among lords, is but a lord

                        <p><emph>Loyalty</emph> is a word by which all that is good for the people
                            is cursed in the name of the king. A loyalist is a man who <del>curses
                                the</del> hungers and thirsts for the plunder of the people. The man

                            desires to see the many the prey of the few.</p>
                        <p><emph>The Few</emph>. I consider the fact to be certain, that according
                            to the present institutions of this country, a small number of persons
                            are invested hereditarily with the powers of government. These they do
                            not exercise altogether without restraint. There is more or less of a
                            dread of the discontent of the many. What is the interest of men in such
                            a situation is obvious. It is their great interest to divide the many,
                            by persuading one part of them, that the other part is their enemy. In
                            this lies their only resource. They therefore calumniate those of them
                            who are the most, to those who are the least destitute of property. Out
                            of what is the clear and incontrovertible interest of those few, arise
                            all the phenomena of our political atmosphere. The discontent of the
                            people being the only restraint upon these few; therefore, their great
                            enemy; of course they hate it; of course they exert all their faculties
                            to pant [<emph>sic</emph> paint] it odious.</p>

                            <emph>Disaffection—Disloyalty</emph>. All this means, or it does not
                            mean, discontent of the people against bad government. If you say, that
                            it is unreasonable discontent, where the government is not bad; this I
                            am sure of, that the governing few, upon whose will it is the only
                            source of restraint, will always call it unreasonable; and where it is
                            the most strongly deserved, there will they be sure the most hatefully
                            to defame it.—People never disaffected without cause,

                            is all that is desired as the end. This however implies the most abject
                            prostration, and all the cruelty necessary to maintain it, as the

                            not here enter,” says Burke, “into the unsatisfactory
                                disquisition concerning representation, real or presumed. I only
                                say, that a great people, who have their property, without any
                                reserve, in all cases, disposed of by another people at an immense
                                distance from them, will not think themselves in the enjoyment of
                                freedom. It will be hard to shew to those who are in such a state,
                                which of the usual parts of the definition, or description of a free
                                people are applicable to them; and it is neither pleasant nor wise
                                to attempt to prove that they have no right to be comprehended in
                                such a description.” Apply this to ourselves: “A
                                great people who have their property disposed of by a handful of
                                persons among themselves will not think themselves in the enjoyment

                            affairs; are useless in considering the present state of the European
                            world. That state is something perfectly new. There are elements in its
                            composition, which never had any existence in the world before. These
                            elements are not few in number; and in power they are already great, and
                            sure in the long run, to be greater than any other. All are the effects
                            of printing, and the spread _diffusion_ of knowledge among the people.
                            Reason upon this point, then, if you would know the future destinies of
                            men. Trace the effects of knowledge, pervading the mass of the people,
                            and growing daily more and more ascendant; you will then be able to
                            trace the future history of your country. The man who reasons, at the
                            present day, upon the affairs of his country, and leaves this element
                            out of his calculation, appears to be nearly as wise as the man who
                            should leave out of his calculation that they have the gift of speech.
                            To a man of the old-lord alias old-lady school, one might say, All this
                            my dear Sir is exceedingly good, and well computed—the addition and
                            subtraction is perfectly correct; you have only left out of your
                            calculation an ingredient which is of more importance than all the rest.
                            We have to do with a people who can read and write; and whom you can no
                            more prevent from reading and writing, than you can prevent the blood
                            from flowing in their veins. Unless then we ascertain all the effects of
                            this reading and writing, we know nothing; and our talk is only vacant
                            air. Tell me what are the effects of a people reading and writing. That
                            is the great problem. Tell me what those effects are, and I will tell

                            <emph>Controul</emph>. Per Burke, the People the only instrument of
                            controul. Query: By what means can they controul? Answer, by none but
                            the power of chusing and dismissing the rulers. Burke says, “The
                                true statesman thinks of the place in which political power is to be
                                lodged, with no other attention, than as it may render the more or
                                the less practicable, its salutary restraint, and its prudent
                                direction. For this reason, no legislator, at any period of the
                                world, has willingly placed the seal of active power in the hands of
                                the multitude: because there it admits of no control, no regulation,
                                no steady direction whatsoever. The people are the natural control
                                on authority; but to exercise and to control together is
                                contradictory and impossible.”

                                government</emph>. You allow that the constitution of the parliament
                            affords no security for good government, unless in as far as it is under
                            the influence of public opinion. But how is public opinion to produce
                            restraint? If it is always in favour of the conduct of the government?
                            That is impossible. It can only operate as a restraint, if discontent is
                            expressed, whenever the conduct is bad; and not only expressed, but with
                            a vehemence which implies something more than expression, if the bad is
                            not immediately changed into good. If the people expressed their
                            discontent ever so clearly; but it were fully understood that they never
                            would do any thing more, who could have any motive to care for their
                            discontent? It is not discontent merely which can therefore do any
                            good—it is the prospect of resistance. Would you, therefore, if you
                            could, extinguish discontent? Is that your purpose? Then we understand
                            you. The removal of all restraint upon the abuse of power is the end of
                            your wishes. That is the noble constitution, the glory of this, and the

                            <emph>Depraved Public Opinion</emph>. As all government depends upon
                            public opinion, all bad government depends upon depraved public opinion.
                            From this, it follows, that all those who have an interest in bad
                            government, have <del>motives to</del> an interest in doing as much as
                            in them lies, to deprave <del>public men</del> the public mind. When
                            reason is against a man, says the philosopher, a man will be against
                            reason. If <del>the people are possessed of reason, how the t</del> A
                            people, with the least light of reason, see the evils of a bad
                            government; and seeing also the remedy, will endeavour to apply it. The
                            grand object therefore is to prevent them seeing with the eyes of
                            reason. One of the modes of depraving the public mind is—to make it
                            attend to forms, rather than substance; to ceremonies, and frivolities,
                            rather than real means to valuable ends; to make them believe as many
                            things as possible without evidence—to foster a habit of adopting
                            opinions without evidence—to encourage all manner of absurd opinions,
                            the more absurd the better—to propagate hatred of all men who

                            <emph>Property insecure</emph>. If the people are hostile to property,
                            why do they allow the existence of it now? You must either say that they
                            are not able, or that they are not willing [to seize property]. And you
                            must say that they are not able. But this it is a perfect contradiction
                            in terms to say; for there is no power but what is made out of their
                            obedience. Besides, is it not an established maxim, that the existence
                            of government depends upon opinion? namely the opinion that it is good
                            to obey, in other words the will to obey. If you say that this well may
                            be the result of fear: namely the fear of the soldier, this does not
                            ameliorate your argument; because the soldiers are part of the people;
                            and you only get the forced obedience of the first people by the willing
                            obedience of the other. How do you persuade the soldiers, that it is not
                            for their interest to make the division of property?</p>

                            You talk of representing classes; do you not perceive that by so doing,
                            you <hi rend="underline">make</hi> two classes, which, as concerned with
                            government, swallow up all the rest. You make a class of electors, and a
                            class of non-electors. By the very supposition, the non-electors are
                            unrepresented. What are the consequences of making a class of electors?
                            Or rather, what do you mean by the word class, when you talk of
                            representation by classes? You mean, do you not, people who are put into
                            such a situation, that they have some powerful interest in common, not
                            shared by the rest of the community? Into this situation you put
                            immediately those whom you single out to be the electors of the
                            governing few. Now, all government means this, that securities ought to

                            at the expense of others, if they can? The class of electors will, like
                            other men, pursue their interest at the expense of the non-electors, if
                            they can. It is incumbent, therefore, upon those, who propose to

                            is really the cause, provided all these intermediate wills are commanded
                            by another will. The will of the general is cause of all the operations

                            The friends of this cheat inform us, that it is the fault of the

                            dependants. The real English of this apology is, that men should not be
                            dependants. It is not very necessary, upon this occasion, at least, to
                            settle that point of political morality. The fact is, that there are
                            dependants, and that there will continue to be dependants. We must deal,
                            therefore, with the fact. And hence the question is, how we are to deal
                            with dependants? The answer <del>in this case</del> is easy: We can, to
                            this purpose, enable them to act as if they were not dependants. To be a
                            dependant is to be so in the power of another man for good or for evil,
                            as to have an overbearing motive to act as he directs. <note>On 154

                            Of two immoralities, that which is the least hurtful to mankind, if you
                            cannot deliver yourself from both, is that which you chuse to retain. If
                            you are suffering by one great immorality, and if there is but one means
                            of delivering yourself from it, that of supplanting it by an immorality
                            under which the evil will be less, it is morality, and the best sort of
                            morality, of two evils to chuse the least. Whatever, therefore, it may
                            please you to say of the immorality which is implied in the use of the
                            ballot, I answer it all by undertaking to prove, that it is submitting
                            to one evil, as a means, and the only means of getting rid of a

                            <emph>Property must be represented</emph>. This is an obscure
                            expression, somewhat equivocal. The meaning is that men of property must
                            be represented. But all men are men of property. Therefore, the real
                            meaning of this pretension is, that men of large property should be
                            represented. Well, no body says they should not. Each man of large
                            property shall have his share along with the rest.—Oh, but he must have
                            more than his share.—Why? Because large property is not safe, if men of
                            small property have the power of dividing it among them. But, if the
                            majority of the governing assembly is chosen by people of small</p><pb/>

                        <p>property, they will have the power of making this division. The majority,
                            therefore, must be chosen by men of large property. This is the
                            rigourous meaning of the <del>pretension</del> argument. It goes fully
                            to this extent. It is an argument which may be refuted, by a reduction
                            to absurdity, of the most remarkable properties. It is an argument in
                            favour of great property, from which it would necessarily result that
                            great property ought not to exist. <del>But property ought to exist,
                                this</del> An argument, <del>therefore</del> from which so false a
                            conclusion is deducible, is evidently absurd. The deduction, <del>is
                                incontrovertible. It</del> (incontrovertible)—flows from this
                            principle, that whatever is contrary to the good of mankind, ought to be
                            abolished. You say, however, that great masses of property, cannot exist
                            in one man’s hands, unless to its security, every security, for the
                            rights and interests of other people be sacrificed. It follows clearly
                            upon these principles, that great property ought not to exist.</p>

                            it will be thought at the first view of things, that if power, wealth,

                                of mankind will evince, that lawful and settled authority is very
                                seldom resisted when it is well employed. Gross corruption, or
                                evident imbecility, is necessary to the suppression of that

                                for was in that House. Mr. Pitt differed with Mr. Fox. Mr. Pitt said

                            despot: And his chusing to govern by this faction, is—“in order
                                to avoid that monstrous evil, of governing in concurrence with the
                                opinion of the people.”
                            <emph>Pres. Discontents</emph>, p. 63. A government must govern, either
                            in concurrence with the opinion of the people, or not in that
                            concurrence. If not in concurrence, the government is a despotism. If in
                            concurrence, the government is essentially democratical.

                                their purposes. It is indeed their greatest, and sometimes their
                                incurable corruption. For there is a material distinction between

                                is a general previous sanction to misgovernment, and, Secondly, the
                                setting up any claims adverse to the right of free election; for
                                this tends to subvert the legal authority by which the House of

                            the strong, the glaring reason, that should mark out for the scorn of
                            these highly illuminated _privileged_ _gifted_ experts, the men who say,
                            that in going as far as they can, they find nothing to stop them from
                            going all the way? The onus of proof lies glaringly upon those who would
                            restrict. Unless they can, I do not say <hi rend="underline"

                            principles—the crown no longer acts by its prerogative, when it means a
                            stretch or an abuse of power—it gets parliament to do the business for
                            it—this is the best of all things for the crown. But thus it happens

                            a bad use of this power, they are equally so to make a bad use of every

                            <emph>Machine works well</emph>. This wretched metaphor thrust forward
                            as an answer to all arguments for reform. On this subject, contrast the
                            different theories of the Whigs and Tories. The Tories content
                            themselves with applause of the <hi rend="underline">working</hi>. The

                            them, the government is a bad machine, which works well. The Whigs on
                            the other hand abuse the working. The machine, they affirm, has worked
                            abominably, <del>at least</del> for the last 50 years and upwards. From
                            the commencement of the reign of George III, the Whigs have been almost
                            constantly in opposition; arraigning the ministers for an uninterrupted
                            course of misgovernment, in which they were supported by the two houses
                            of parliament. According, therefore, to the Whigs, the machine works not
                            well, but ill. When the reformers, however, observing this, ask the
                            amendment of the machine, the Whigs begin immediately to load them with
                            imputations; as if any improvement of the machine would be full of
                            mischief. Or, if they propose any thing under the name of improvement,
                            it is something which is improvement in name only. According to the
                            Tories, therefore, the government is a bad machine, which works well.
                            According to the Whigs, it is a good machine which works ill.</p>

                            throughout the Tract on the causes of the present discontents. At pp. 15
                            and 44, he says, that the concurrence of the people in the government
                            was annihilated, the moment the court took to itself the use of its own
                            vast influence. At p. 63, he says, that government without the
                            concurrence of the people is despotism. The moment you govern without
                            the concurrence of the people, you may call your government what you
                            please; it consists of three orders (powers if you please) cavalry,
                            infantry, artillery—these and nothing else whatsoever—nothing more or
                            better—At p. 12 Burke says, that the king’s power by influence is far
                            greater than it ever was by prerogative—and by prerogative, it was
                            despotical. p. 94. Parliament once under influence, “the best
                                appendage and support of arbitrary power that ever was invented by

                            interests of the several classes. But what is meant by the interest of a
                            class? This is an important question. Is it the interest which the class
                            has in common with all the rest of the community? No; for in that case
                            it would need no peculiar representation. A class interest, then, is an
                            interest, in opposition to the interest of the community. When you
                                <del>represent</del> compose a government, then, of class
                            representatives, you compose it <del>exclusively of men, having</del> of
                            three or four or more sets of men, having, each set, an interest hostile
                            to the community. It is easy to see what they will do.—There is in
                            Grote’s pamphlet, an excellent analysis of Individual interest, Class
                            interest, and National interest. The individual interest is of course
                            the foundation of every thing. Out of that, the other interests are
                            made. Every individual has a great many interests peculiar to himself,
                            beyond what he has in common with any class. A merchant has an interest,
                            along with other merchants, in getting high profits; in obtaining a
                            monopoly in short. But he has a great many separate interests as an
                            individual; he has an interest in getting legacies for himself, in
                            getting a rich wife, in making good bargains and so on. The class
                            interest, therefore, is made, by leaving out all that is peculiar in the
                            interests of the individual, and retaining only those which the
                            individual has in common with some aliquot part, less or greater, of the
                            community. The class interest, again, includes a greater number of
                            particulars, than the national interest, or those advantages in which
                            all the nation participates. A merchant participates with a landholder,
                            or lawyer, and so forth, in receiving protection from foreign invasion,
                            or protection from theaves [thieves], and so on. But the class of
                            merchants have interests beyond this, in common with one another. So
                            have the lawyers, and other classes. All interests that are not held in
                            common, are opposite. In this way, the private interest, it appears, is
                            that which is not included in the class interest; the class interest is
                            that which is not included in the public interest. Of these three
                            interests, therefore, each excludes the other. <note>Anon., (George

                            here, from dividing the property of the rich. The interest which the
                            whole of the American population have in common, is the same with that
                            which the whole of every country have in common. The interest which the
                            American <hi rend="underline">many</hi> have in combining with the
                            American <hi rend="underline">few</hi> in respecting proprietary rights,
                            is the same whole [<emph>sic</emph> which] the many would have in every
                            situation. The many, if we should be absurd enough to suppose them
                            hostile to the proprietary rights of the few, must be friendly to the
                            proprietary rights of one another. But if so, the question is decided,
                            they respect property, where it is their interest to respect it. No
                            farther ought they. <note>Mill’s argument here closely reproduces that

                            tyrants, when masters of the government, had borrowed a sum of money of
                            the Lacedæmonians, to be employed in resisting the body of the people,
                            who had taken possession of the Pyræus, and were making efforts for the
                            expulsion of the tyrants. After the popular government was restored, the
                            Lacedæmonians sent to demand payment. The question was debated before
                            the people; and it was <del>affirmed</del> contended by some, that
                            payment, if made at all, should be made by those who were

                                advantage, so that one cannot find the least spot of ground, that is
                                not made to contribute its utmost to the owner. In all the
                                inhabitants there appears an air of cheerfulness and plenty, not
                                often to be met with in those of the countries which lie about them.
                                … This republic, for the extent of its dominions, is esteemed the
                                richest and best peopled state of Italy. The whole administration of
                                the government passes into different hands at the end of every two
                                months, which is the greatest security imaginable to their liberty,
                                and wonderfully contributes to the quick dispatch of all public
                                affairs.”

                                way from Rome to Naples, I found nothing so remarkable as the beauty
                                of the country, and the extreme poverty of its inhabitants. It is
                                indeed an amazing thing to see the present desolation of Italy, when
                                one considers what incredible multitudes of people it abounded with
                                under the Roman emperors.”—After a striking enumeration of
                            the means of happiness in the Pope’s dominions, he says, “But
                                notwithstanding all these promising circumstances, there is not a
                                more miserable people in Europe than the Pope’s subjects. His state
                                is thin of inhabitants, and a great part of his soil uncultivated.
                                His subjects are wretchedly poor and idle, and have neither
                                sufficient manufactures nor traffic to employ them. These ill
                                effects may arise, in a great manner, out of the arbitrariness of
                                the government, but I think they are chiefly to be ascribed to the
                                very genius of the Catholic religion.”

                            <emph>Property</emph>. That the People should wish to destroy property
                            is a contradiction in terms. Why should they wish to take those good
                            things from the few, if they do not wish them to be secure to
                            themselves? The moment the people declare war against property, property
                            ceases to exist; and no man has a motive to take any thing from any
                            other, except what may gratify an immediate desire. If a man wishes to
                            take property from another, it is in the hope that it will be secure to
                            him. He wishes all other men to respect the rights of his property. But
                            this he can obtain upon one condition only—that of respecting
                            theirs.—There is another argument. The very people who affirm and
                            maintain, that the people, if they had the power would destroy the
                            rights of property, do yet affirm that to the people the rights of
                            property are of the greatest advantage. This affirmation is clear. They
                            say that government is for the good of the greatest number; if it was
                            not, the extinction of it would be desirable. One of the great ends of
                            government is the preservation of property. Therefore the preservation
                            of property is for the good of the people.—Again, A respect for the laws
                            of property is implicit in the very circumstances of people’s living
                            together in society. Observe how it is. If people live in society, they
                            must agree to allow one another to enjoy certain things; for the not
                            living in society means, that no man allows another to enjoy any thing.
                            But these certain things consist of the powers of one’s own body; and
                            such commodities as are conducive to pleasure or well being. To allow
                            one another, to enjoy, according to certain rules, things conducive to
                            pleasure and well-being, is to establish and respect the laws of
                            property.</p>

                                found means at last to set him at rest, by showing him, that,
                                however formidable might be its present appearance, it would, after
                                some ineffectual struggles, fall to nothing. Whatever notions may be
                                formed of the levity and inconsiderateness of those whom we are
                                pleased to term the vulgar, I have always found, that, though they
                                may fix upon some particular aims, and follow them not only with
                                rashness but rapture, yet those aims are always to a certain degree
                                general, and directed to some common interest; but that any private
                                ends, such as proceed from the anger or wishes of a particular man,
                                or of a small number, are never long or much regarded. I will
                                venture to say further, that of general interests the voice of the
                                people will give the most certain judgement.” [F]

                            <emph>Property</emph>. I put this question on a short issue. Is it for
                            the benefit of the labourer, or is it not—that he should be secured in
                            the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour—and that this enjoyment should
                            include as much as it can include without injury to others? Should the
                            enjoyment not be extended to him as far as possible? Should not the
                            motive to create property be made as great as possible? Is not that
                            motive made greater, when a man himself is not only allowed to make
                            undisturbed use of what his labour has produced, but to leave it to his
                            children? and when he knows that his children also will have the same
                            privileges as he himself has had? To give them these privileges, is to
                            establish all the laws of property.—The many cannot violate the rules of
                            property, with respect to the few, without <del>violating those
                                rules</del> lessening the binding force of them, with respect to
                            themselves. But property is constituted by the binding force of those
                            rules. It is not property, unless in so far as those rules are valid.
                            Why should the poor desire to take from the rich? That they may have the
                            good things to themselves. But of what use are good things to the man
                            who is not allowed to keep them? Is the man who possesses 10 sh.
                            benefited, if he adds a shilling to them, but renders it ten times more
                            probable that the first strong man, who hears of his possession will
                            come and take it from him? It is perfectly certain that a very small
                            diminution of security, is equivalent to a great addition
                                [<emph>sic</emph> reduction] of quantity. Observe how much a small
                            defect in the title of an estate lessens the price.—That the Many
                            recognize all this, and have always recognized it, is proved by this
                            incontestable fact, that property exists. Shew, that it ever could have
                            done so, without the consent of the many. The many saw it was for their
                            advantage in the most barbarous state. You say that they will not see
                            it, in the most refined. The laws of property mean a combination of the
                            many to protect themselves against the few—the many honest—against the
                            few thieves. Why are you just said the Priest to the Philosopher? For
                            fear of injustice, was the reply. Why do I respect other men’s property?
                            That they may respect mine. It is more my interest that the little I
                            possess should be secure, than that I should double it, and take away
                            the security.—— What is the reason that the rich respect the property of
                            one another? If you have 10,000 rich, why do the 9,000 refrain from the
                            plunder of the 1,000 ? They have exactly the same interest, which the
                            9,000,000 would have in dividing the property of the 1,000,000.

                                that is to say, having a very general acquaintance with facts,
                                coupled with a total absence of principles in matters of government;
                                calling every fixed rule mere abstraction, and placing his

                            <emph>Reform not necessary</emph>. Why is it not necessary? The reasons
                            are various and cogent. First of all, They are all villains who say it
                            is necessary. This is sound and substantial, and why? because they are
                            all villains who dare to dispute the strength of it.—Well, this is one
                            argument. Favour us with another. The Greeks, or more properly speaking,
                            the Athenians, were all villains; and at a time when all the rest of the
                            world was distinguished for civilization and morality, were sunk in the
                            truest brutality and barbarism. A third reason, why the British
                            constitution needs no improvement is, that the people who say it does
                            are called Radicals. A fourth reason is, that Mr. Canning says, it is
                            not needed. A fifth reason is that Mr. Hume’s name is Joseph, that he
                            was an assistant surgeon in India, and made a small fortune there—that
                            he very often speaks Scotch, and sometimes makes grammatical blunders. A

                            reason is, That Robespierre cut throats. A seventh reason is that George
                            the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is the best of princes. An eighth reason is,
                            that Cobbett and Hunt are rather suspicious characters. A ninth reason
                            is, that the world has always been very foolish; and therefore there is
                            no reason it should improve. <note>This paragraph is reproduced

                                insinuate themselves at first, and creep on by degrees: they begin
                                usually in some act of accommodation and kindness, which we can
                                hardly disapprove in the particular instance; the same faculty is
                                practiced in a second instance, on little other ground than the
                                precedent of the first: an irregularity, which was hardly
                                censurable, ripens into settled abuse; new men come into office, and
                                they find it become an ancient established practice, with all the
                                sanction of grey hairs upon it: one abuse begets another (for it is
                                a prolific family), till at last attention is awakened, and those
                                who have authority, are loudly called upon by duty to correct. They

                                    auxiliary to laws, always has been, and always must be, a
                                    miserable and inefficient substitute for them. The rules of

                                    its decisions are capricious. Its condemnation frequently spares
                                    the guilty, and falls on the innocent. It is terrible to

                                    2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> ser., <emph>PD</emph>, XV 135, he
                                remarked that “it was more hard on his majesty’s
                                    opposition.” Canning made a jesting response to this
                                remark, <emph>ibid</emph>., 137, and George Tierney, the leader of
                                the Whigs, then remarked that “we are to all intents and
                                    purposes, a branch of his majesty’s government.” This he
                                amplified by referring to his group as “his majesty’s opposition,”

                        <p><emph>Calumny of the People</emph>. A remarkable case of the mode in
                            which the same thing is characterized in the people, and their rulers,
                            is shewn in elections. The being a ministerial man, for the sake of the
                            good things which may be obtained, is the habit of the great majority of
                            the aristocratical class. Is this any disgrace to them in that class?
                            The very reverse. (Witness corn-laws—Burdett’s speech.) These men live
                            in the habit of serving their particular interest at the expense of the
                            public, as much as they can. At an election, there are certain bodies of
                            electors who have an opportunity of doing the same thing, serving their
                            particular, at the expense of the general interest. No reproach is
                            thought too severe for them. It is curious enough, that those who are
                            most obstreperous in the language of reproach to the people, are those
                            who betray the strongest inward conviction of their superior virtue. Why
                            should a preference of their own to the public interest have greater
                            turpitude when seen in some of the people than seen among their rulers,
                            unless that the standard of virtue among them being higher such an
                            action in one of the people is a greater descent? The electors are
                            regularly called upon to play the patriots at an election, to reject
                            private considerations, and return good men. This implies that they are
                            capable of being acted upon by these motives. Who makes such an address
                            to the place-hunting tribes, without being an object of ridicule? Who
                            expects any benefit from a self-denying sermon addressed to the
                            aristocratical, the government-supporting, his Majesty’s Ministerial or
                            Majesty’s Opposition classes, alias job-courting, alias tax-making,

                        intended to write a book or books on law and law reform. This is seemingly
                        confirmed in correspondence between Mill and Macvey Napier, with a letter
                        dated 5/8/1818 stating: “I am anxious to say, if I could, something
                            useful on the subject of conveyancing. I have looked into the subject
                            with a good deal of care, and have often conversed upon it with Bentham.
                            There is nothing in any book beyond the practice of the different
                            systems of actual law. Principles upon the subject nobody has thought of
                            exhibiting. As far as it has been touched upon in any of Bentham’s Mss.,
                            it is under the head of Evidence, where it falls into the chapter on
                            what he calls “Preappointed Evidence,” or those articles of Evidence,
                            consisting chiefly of writings brought into existence at the present
                            moment, for ascertaining at some future period a matter of fact which
                            had its existence now, or at some antecedent period. I believe you will
                            find this the general characteristic of all the branches of
                            conveyancing. The act of transferring is the volition of the parties;
                            the writings are the mode of providing evidence of that volition. To
                            discuss the subject, you must work out this general idea by the force of
                            your own philosophy. You will get no assistance from lawbooks or from
                            lawyers. You do not know, perhaps, what is my presumption on the subject
                            of Law. The next work I meditate is a History of English Law, in which I
                            mean to trace, as far as possible, the expedients of the several ages to
                            the state of the human mind, and the circumstances of society in those
                            ages, and to show their concord or discord with the standard of
                            perfection; and I am not without hopes of making a book readable by all,
                            and if so, a book capable of teaching law to all. And, after this, I
                            will do what I can to exhibit in full a system of jurisprudence to the
                            world.” <note>Macvey Napier, <emph>Selected Correspondence of the

                    <p>It is also very apparent what their tone and thrust would have been. They
                        would have contained a wholesale condemnation of the irrational and
                        illogical body of law, and the corrupt, and cumbersome structure of the
                        courts, of that period. What we have here is material for a series of
                        projects never completed, though one should note Mill’s <emph>Encyclopaædia
                            Britannica</emph> articles on “Jurisprudence” and “Prisons and Prison
                        Discipline,” and the remains of material for projects on which Mill assisted
                        Bentham from 1808 to 1814-1815.</p>

                        <p>Endless and immeasurable are the praises we hear from lawyers on the
                            matchless advantages of jury trial. But the greater any one allows to be
                            the advantages of juries, the greater he asserts to be the
                            untrustworthiness of judges. By those accordingly who assert the
                            advantages of jury trial to be past compare, the untrustworthiness of
                            judges is proclaimed to be complete. According to the doctrine of the
                            excellence of juries, Judges as such are to be deemed always in theory,
                            and of course generally in fact, to be men ready to sacrifice the just
                            to the unjust; that is, must always be men exposed to the operation of
                            such interests as have an irresistible tendency to lead them in that
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Such then being the nature of judges—such the baneful tendency of their
                            influence—such the undeniable meaning of the praises of juries—how is
                            the power shared between those two constituent parts of the English
                            judicatories—the one essentially corrupt—the other matchlessly pure? The
                            impure part has, by express role almost every thing—the pure part, by
                            consequence, almost nothing.</p>
                        <p>Juries, say the judges, must judge only of the fact, we of the law. With
                            regard to one whole half of the power competent to judicature, this
                            makes the judges masters of it at a stroke. One half of the power
                            consists in condemning; the other half in acquitting. This gives them
                            the power of acquitting every individual that comes before them. Enemies
                            of the liberty and constitution of the country—plunderers, and evil
                            doers of all descriptions, it renders them natural dependants; the
                            situation of the judge in relation to such characters being, at once,
                            that of patron, despot, and protector. In regard to the other part of
                            the power of judicature, that of condemning, if a jury will not allow
                            that the fact submitted to their cognisance has been done, or has been
                            done by the man who is accused of it, the power of the judge is indeed
                            stopped. But suppose it to be very clear that the fact really had
                            [taken] place, and really had the man accused for the author of it, in
                            that case an honest jury must bring their verdict against him, and now
                            the judge’s power of condemning is complete. Be the fact what it may, be
                            it as far from a mischievous fact as it can be conceived to be—no
                            matter, the judge has power to condemn and to punish. Let a proper
                            concert be, on this ground, established between a set of prosecutors and
                            a set of judges, no man is safe. The prosecutor charges with a fact as
                            criminal, of which he is sure he can bring proof. The jury finds—the
                            judge condemns.</p>
                        <p>Blackstone says, v. 3, p. 329 that the difficulty of litigated cases
                            hardly ever arises from the difficulty of the law—but from the obscurity
                            and intricacy of the matter of fact. Juries in all cases left to
                            struggle with the difficulties of the matter of fact—even sent to them
                            by equity judges when it puzzles themselves—but lawyers are desirous of
                            delivering [juries] from the difficulties of the law, which by their own
                            account are the least difficulties. <note>Blackstone,

                        <p>Blackstone—when praising Juries—is consistent enough to allow that judges

                            depredation, the Hon. Roger North, in his <emph>life</emph> of his
                            brother the lord Keeper Guilford, says, “The country is yet very
                                sharp upon thieves; and a violent suspicion there is next to
                                conviction. When his lordship held the assizes at Newcastle, there
                                was one Mungo Noble (supposed to be a great thief) brought to trial
                                before his lordship, upon four several indictments; and his lordship
                                was so much a south country judge as not to think any of them well
                                proved. One was, for stealing the horse of a person unknown: And the
                                evidence amounted to no more than that a horse was seen feeding upon
                                the heath near his shiel […] and none could tell who was the owner
                                of it. In short, the man escaped, much to the regret of divers
                                gentlemen, who thought he deserved to be hanged, and that was
                                enough.” p. 270. Where the crime is much detested, juries
                            satisfied with little proof. <note>North, <emph>The Life of Francis

                        <p>If there is any subject closer to Mill’s heart,
                        but further from his own political practice, than this, it is difficult to
                        know what it is. Some of the material in this section shows up in his last

                        the announced set of projects to be found in the final pages of his

                        <p>In other countries the rule has been to let action be guided by reason.
                            In England no rule so thoroughly exploded. It is the object of never
                            ending abuse. Many a man enjoys a great reputation for no other merit
                            than that of railing at it.—To make deliberation precede action; to make
                            mind take the lead; and the hand execute what the mind has planned; to
                            act with thought, not without it, these are some of the predominant
                            maxims which have guided nations, and individuals. To plunge into action
                            without deliberation; to make no use of mind before proceeding to
                            action; to banish thought as the guide of conduct, has elsewhere been
                            looked upon as characterising beings either altogether irrational or
                            approaching to irrationality. This however is the new fashion of wisdom
                            followed in England. To think before action, abominable! Away with it!
                            Speculation! Metaphysics! Abstraction! Theory! To act without thought,
                            excellent! Practical! safe! experimental! Wise! Cautious! prudent! not
                            rash! Practice is the admirable course! Speculation, is leaping in the
                            dark, leaping among pitfalls, and on the brink of precipices. Wisdom is
                            folly; folly only is wisdom. Thought is dangerous. Want of thought is
                            safe. Walk blindfold, you are sure to walk well. Open your eyes, you
                            fall upon evil immediately. Aristotle, writing to his pupil Alexander,
                            tries to turn his attention, to the wisdom <hi rend="underline"
                                >Non-English</hi> and seems, (not being able to foresee the
                            excellencies of the English constitution), that it was the wisdom of all
                                    nations—“<hi rend="underline">Moreover</hi>, I think it
                                must be manifest to you that <hi rend="underline">we praise as noble
                                    and good those persons who employ reason</hi> and who make a
                                principle of carrying on all their affairs with its aid, <hi
                                    rend="underline">whereas we hate those who act without
                                    reason</hi> as being savage and bestial.” [G]
                                <emph>Rhet. pro Alex</emph>., c. 1.—A few lines farther on, he says,
                                “Moreover, of all human things counsel is the most
                                divine.” [G] <emph>Ibid</emph>.—Again—“For what
                                person possessing intelligence could ever question that it is a sign
                                of folly to act without deliberation, and a mark of education to
                                accomplish by the guidance of reason something that reason commands?
                                It may be seen that all the peoples of Greece possessing the best
                                governments engage in discussion before embarking on action, and in
                                addition to these, those foreigners also that have the highest
                                repute employ discussion before action, well knowing that the
                                consideration of what is expedient by means of discussion is the
                                citadel of safety. That is the citadel which should be deemed
                                impregnable—no fortress that consists of buildings should be thought
                                safe and secure. However, I am reluctant to continue writing more,
                                lest perchance, if I bring forward proofs about matters of precise
                                knowledge as if they were not admitted truths, I may be thought to
                                be shewing off.” [G] Aristotle did not foresee that a nation
                            calling itself the wisest of all nations, would after some thousands of
                            years find out that principles which he thought too evident to bear
                            illustration were totally false and eminently mischievous.—It is curious
                            that Aristotle was so far mistaken as to imagine that theory was the
                            only thing on which practice could safely be built.—“I therefore
                                unceasingly exhort you to hold fast to the study of reasoned speech,
                                to which you have long been urged. For education constitutes the
                                safeguard of the mind, in the same way as health is the safeguard of
                                the body; since when education guides it will not befall you to
                                stumble in the path of conduct, but to preserve almost all the good
                                possessions that are your property. … And again, as the general is
                                the preserver of the army, so reason coupled with education is the
                                guide of life.” [G] <emph>Ibid</emph>. In the same passage
                            in which the use of thought is thus applauded, he says that of useful
                            thought there is a necessary <hi rend="underline">precursor</hi>, and
                            that is <hi rend="underline">learning</hi>.—“Resolve to <hi

                                (<emph>Mem</emph>. t. I, p. 229) says, “As he had been
                                brought up from his infancy in the forms of the courts of justice,
                                whatever went out of that road became suspicious to him. There is
                                hardly any disposition more dangerous, in those who are concerned
                                with public affairs where the common rules no longer apply.”

                        <p><emph>NB On the Use and Abuse of Speculation—the Use and Abuse of
                                Practice</emph>. The noble lord explodes speculation; he rejects it;
                            throws it away with both his hands; and kicks at it with both his feet.
                            Practice is the study which engrosses him. But, methinks, a wise
                            statesman would take a turn of both; methinks, he would neglect neither;
                            in hopes that speculation might be the better for practice; and practice
                            the better for speculation. Practice, without speculation, is mere
                            mechanism; and had as well be done by inanimate matter—Practice without
                            speculation, may in any instance be good; but it may as well be bad, for
                            any thing known to, or cared by the mere practiser.</p>
                        <p>“The statesman therefore must legislate with all these
                                considerations in view, both in respects of the parts of the soul
                                and of their activities, and aiming more particularly at the greater
                                goods and the ends. And the same principle applies in regard to
                                modes of life and choices of conduct: a man should be capable of
                                engaging in business and war, but still more capable of living in
                                peace and leisure.” [G] Aristot., <emph>Polit., l</emph>.

                            said, that the book man is guided by his rules, not by the circumstances
                            of the case. Books, however, teach regard to be had to the circumstances
                            of the case, as well as to the rule; to the points in which things
                            differ as well as to those in which they agree. Books present not only
                            rules, but the exceptions to them. There is no error-working bias of the
                            mind, which books do not point out the occasions of, and the remedies
                            for. <note><emph>Of the Advancement of Learning</emph>, B. I, (Folio

                                Works</emph>, pp. 46-7: “And for matter of policy and
                                    government, that learning should rather hurt than enable
                                    thereunto, is a thing very improbable: We see it accounted an
                                    error, to commit a natural body to empirick physicians … we see
                                    it is a like error to rely upon advocates or lawyers, which are
                                    only men of practice, and not grounded in their books … so by
                                    like reason it cannot be but a matter of doubtful consequence,
                                    if states be managed by empirick statesmen, not well mingled
                                    with men grounded in learning. But contrariwise, it is almost
                                    without instance contradictory, that ever any government was
                                    disastrous, that was in the hands of learned

                            in every man’s mind arranged—laid up in parcels—but in the ignorant mind
                            the parcels are few—his <emph>genera</emph> are the

                            expedients of his politician, to cry down all sciences of which he is
                            ignorant, as a man never wishes to enhance the value of what belongs to
                            his antagonist; and besides it is the easiest way of purchasing a
                            reputation in any thing to seem to despise it, as the readiest way to
                            buy cheap is to bring down the price. Many men have no other expedient
                            for appearing deep than appearing to despise all depth in reasoning.

                            sure to act wrong. The business of legislation is wholly theoretical,
                            because it consists wholly in making general rules: for to make general
                            rules is <del>the essence of theory</del> to theorise, and to theorize
                            is to make general rules. It has often been observed by the wise, as a

                            legislators. The reason is found in the very nature of the case. To make
                            good general rules, in which legislation wholly consists, a talent is

                        <p>The theoretical man and the practical man differ in this; that the

                            rashly. The theoretical draws his general rules from a full induction of
                            particular cases: the practical man generalizes his own individual case,
                            and makes it a rule for all others. It is not by <hi rend="underline"

                            “This,” says he, “was the last transaction in that family, which
                                much concerned his lordship: and, if these relations are thought of
                                small import, to mend that fault, I can only add, that they concern
                                my subject, and are true. And from a private family, let the
                                imagination transfer the scene to some royal and imperial court,

                        <p><emph>What can Practice in the Business of Administration do</emph>? It
                            cannot give skill in that to which it is not applied. It can only give
                            skill in that practice. But legislation is not practice. legislation is
                            theorizing; making general rules—rules to embrace not
                                <del>individual</del> particulars, but orders, and sets, and classes
                            of particulars. Practice is so far from giving skill in this, that it
                            prevents the acquiring of skill in it. Practice cannot give any skill in
                            that which is not practice. If any practice can make a man a good
                            legislature [<emph>sic</emph> legislator] it is practice in
                            speculation—practice in that which is the very business of legislation,
                            practice in making general rules, to embrace accurately, orders and
                            classes of particulars. When you talk of practice, one would like to
                            know, practice in what? Not practice in making of shoes? Not practice in
                            curing bodily diseases? Not any sort of practice, then, but practice in
                            that peculiar <del>talent</del> kind of operation, which is the
                            operation in question. This, then, is the very reason, on which I think
                            the philosopher, meaning always by the word philosopher, the man that
                            truly deserves the name. He alone it is that has practice in that which
                            is the distinctive operation of the legislator. The man who is vulgarly
                            called the man of practice has none. To use the most general language
                            first, the business of the legislator is thinking. So is that of the
                            philosopher. The man of mere practice has no occasion for thought. His
                            business is to trudge in a beaten track, which in general he does in a
                            way as mechanical, as that of a horse in the mill. His business is to
                            follow <del>unthinkingly</del> prescribed rules, or an established
                            routine, with seldom any more need for the exercise of thought, than the
                            farmer in what man and horses he shall send to each field, whether he
                            shall sow in it barley or wheat, and what grain he shall first carry to
                            market. The business of the practicalist<del>, and the legis</del>
                            practician, and the legislator, are <del>relatively</del> generically
                            distinct: that of the practician is to follow rules: that of the
                            legislator to make rules. The business of the practician is to collect
                            taxes, and keep account of the disbursements. That of the philosopher to
                            say what and how taxes should be laid; and what should be the objects
                            and limits of the disbursements. It is the business of the practical
                            lawyer the judge, to carry the laws into execution; but that of the
                            legislator to make them. It is the business of the practical statesman
                            to manage the details of the national defence. But it is that of the
                            legislator to determine under what rules, and restrictions this is to be
                            done.—Practice! Why, Yes. The police officer has more skill in
                            thief-catching than I have. But I am better able to tell who should be
                            treated as thieves, and what ought to be done with them. The general has
                            more practice in leading an army; but almost any body is better
                            qualified than the general <del>for legislating</del> to law
                                [<emph>sic</emph> lay] down the laws on which the existence and
                            operations of an army should depend. The admiral can manœuvre a fleet
                            better than the legislator, but the legislator who knows nothing about
                            the manœuvring of a fleet, knows far better than he to judge of the ends
                            to which it is only a means; and the relation in which it stands to
                            other means and ends. This is so well acknowledged, that when the first
                            lord Melville, was appointed first lord of the admiralty, and when some
                            of the opposition objected to him, on account of his want of practice,
                            not being a naval man, in naval affairs, Mr. Pitt replied, that such
                            practice was not necessary, it was indeed hurtful, rather than useful,
                            to the superintendence even of the administration of the navy.
                                <note>Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville, was appointed First Lord of
                                the Admiralty, 15/5/1804. Pitt’s defence is to be found in his

                                lie beyond their capacity; all that’s not set down at large in their
                                books, they account no better than damnable doctrine and heresy:

                            meddling with things he knew nothing about, when he proposed bills for
                            mitigating punishments, and lessening the range of punishment for death;
                            and expressed regret and disapprobation because he did not concert with
                            the judges and others, in the traits of criminal procedure.

                            mode of deciding all questions. In my humble opinion however something
                            more is necessary to prove that a man knows every thing about [the]

                                of policy and government, that learning should rather hurt than
                                enable thereunto, is a thing very improbable. We see it is accounted
                                an error, to commit a natural body to empiric physicians. … We see
                                it is a like error to rely upon advocates or lawyers which are only
                                men of practice and not grounded in their books. … So, by like
                                reason, it cannot be but a matter of doubtful consequence, if states
                                be managed by empiric statesmen, not well mingled with men grounded
                                in learning. But, contrariwise, it is almost without instance
                                contradictory, that ever any government was disastrous, that was in
                                the hands of learned governors. For, howsoever it hath been ordinary
                                with politic men, to extenuate and disable learned men, by the name
                                of pedants: yet in the records of time it appeareth, in many
                                particulars, that governments […] have excelled, even for that
                                reason which they seek to traduce, that the state hath been in the
                                hands of pedants. … Nay, let a man look into the government of the
                                bishops of Rome; or, by name, into the government of Pius Quintus,
                                and Sextus [Sixtus] Quintus in our times, who were both, at their
                                entrance, esteemed but as pedantical friars; and he shall find that

                                or remedy than it offereth cause of indisposition or infirmity. For
                                if, by a secret operation, it make men perplexed and irresolute, on
                                the other side, by plain precept, it teacheth them when, and upon

                                dwell in the exquisite observation or examination of the nature and
                                customs of one person; […] the second, no inability, but a rejection
                                upon choice and judgement, […] for to be speculative into another
                                man, to the end to know how to work upon him, or wind him, or govern
                                him, proceedeth from a heart that is double or cloven, and not
                                entire, and ingenuous. … So, no doubt, many may be well seen in the
                                passages of government and policy, which are to seek in little and
                                punctual occasions.”

                        <p>“Things which we know philosophically are applied to the problems
                                of human life with greater success than the things which we know
                                only historically. It will be proven independently in logic that
                                whatever is predicated of a being belongs to the being only under a
                                certain condition. It makes no difference whether that condition is
                                sought for in the definition or somewhere else. Now he who is
                                acquainted with philosophy knows the reason why a thing is or
                                occurs. Therefore, he perceives the condition under which something
                                is predicated of a being, and consequently, he does not attribute
                                the predicate to the being unless he sees that the condition is
                                present. Hence, we do not err in using what we know philosophically.
                                But when we have only historical knowledge, either we are not aware
                                of the condition or else we do not grasp it fully. For historical
                                knowledge tells us only that a thing can be or occur, and not why it
                                can be or occur. Therefore, it frequently happens that in dealing
                                with the problems of human life we attribute a predicate to a being
                                without the condition under which the being possesses the predicate.
                                As a result, the judgment is false. Thus, we frequently err in using
                                things which we do not know philosophically. And so we have more
                                certain success in using philosophical rather than historical
                                knowledge. … [As an example:] When young shoots of rosemary are
                                planted in the ground at one end, they take root and grow into a
                                bush. But he who would attempt to produce the same result with
                                shoots from any tree labours in vain.” [L] Wolfii,

                        <p>“If the reason of that which belongs to a species is contained in
                                the notion of the genus, then things which we know philosophically
                                are applied to more problems of human life than things which we know
                                only historically. For he who has historical knowledge knows that
                                something is or can be. Hence, he applies what he knows of the
                                subject of a species only to the other subjects of that same
                                species. Now if the reason of that which is attributed to the
                                species is contained in the notion of the genus, then this attribute
                                should be applied to the whole genus, and, consequently, to all the
                                other species of that genus.” [L] <emph>Ibid</emph>., § 42:

                        <p>“When things which are restricted to a special case by historical
                                knowledge can be stated more universally, philosophical knowledge
                                decreases the number of propositions. Hence, he who is instructed
                                with a less scattered knowledge is prepared for more cases.”

                                mischief of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of
                                great affairs. Never have the servants of the state looked at the
                                whole of your complicated interests in one connected view. They have

                                regard to their relations or dependencies. They never had any kind

                                mischief, in order to pilfer piece-meal a repeal of an act, which

                        <p>“Mr. Turgot has been accused of a spirit of system. If by this is
                                meant, that all his operations, even in their detail, were so many
                                parts of a regular and general plan; that this plan, and the motives
                                which dictated all his decisions, were the result of a small number
                                of principles, strictly combined; some of them discovered by
                                himself, and none of them adopted, till he had scrupulously analysed
                                and developed [all] their proof.—if this be the meaning of the word,
                                I acknowledge that M. Turgot possessed the spirit of system. […] In
                                this case, the reproach carries the highest, to some the most
                                formidable eulogium that can be bestowed on a minister. It
                                proclaims, at once, the strength of character that is necessary to
                                form and execute a comprehensive and well-combined plan, and an
                                inclination to prefer truth and duty to interest and passion: while
                                it takes away all hope from those whose interests are opposed to
                                such principles.—If by system is meant, a disdain of established
                                prejudices; of the maxims of feeble and uncertain politics; of
                                contradictory principles, whether held at one and the same time, or
                                one after another; and, lastly, of operations by halves, the result
                                of narrow and incoherent views—M. Turgot had, indeed, the spirit of
                                system. But if we understand by spirit of system, a love of novelty
                                and paradoxes, a taste for capricious measures, vague principles, or

                                and it was precisely to guard himself with the greater security
                                against them, that he had ordered all his principles to a regular

                        <p><emph>Details</emph>. There are two ways of going through matters of
                            detail. One man goes through them, with no other view than just to go
                            through them again; and so on, as often as the end he has in view
                            requires. Another man goes through the matters of detail, with a view to
                            draw from them general rules; he uses them as the materials of a
                            philosophic induction. The first goes through them, as a horse goes
                            round in a mill; without carrying his thoughts beyond the series of
                            steps he is required to perform. The second goes through them with a
                            mind that pervades; that separates, and combines; that goes beyond, in
                            short, to something more extensive and noble. Of the first sort, are all
                            the hackneyed mechanical merchants, who perform the business of buying
                            as cheap as possible, and selling as dear, with a mind that never stirs
                            beyond these operations; that thinks of nothing but repeating the same
                            round which it has just finished, and for the same end. Of that sort are
                            also the hackneyed drudges of the law, who run the round of [true] bill,
                            declaration, reply, and all the other incidents of a suit, with a state
                            of mind, <note>‘with no <del>other</del> state of mind’ in ms.</note>
                            the same as that of the horse in the mill; merely to repeat the round,
                            which has just been finished; but who never think of drawing any general
                            rules from the matters of detail which they are satisfied with
                            repeating. But if a man goes through matters of detail, without ever
                            thinking of any thing but the operations, it is plain he can never be
                            any thing else but a man of detail, a hackneyed performer of mechanical
                            operations, of which he has learned the habit, or dexterity by
                            practice.</p>

                            is an art: cooking is not an art, but a certain knack or practice, which
                            performs things by imitation or routine without knowledge. See Plato’s
                                <emph>Gorgias</emph>, for his famous division of practices, into
                            Kolakeiai [flattery, fawning] and Texnai [art, craft, cunning]—the first
                            seeking only, immediate gratification, the other seeking good—the first
                            without knowledge, save the narrow and confined experience of the
                            particular case; the other founded on the knowledge of causes and

                                vindicate the very elements of the science: at any rate it is
                                impossible satisfactorily to maintain an argument on practical
                                measures, without pointing out the dependency of our positions on
                                those first principles which are generally received as true. … The
                                advocates of our present financial system […] at one time deny the
                                fundamental principles alledged by their opponents; at another, they
                                dispute the connection between the cases adduced and those
                                principles; but still oftener do they seek to involve the question
                                in darkness and mystery, by bringing forward facts, apparently at
                                variance with those principles, and leaving their adversaries to
                                account for them:—thus playing a safer part, than if they openly
                                denied the principles themselves; and by a trick of sophistry,
                                throwing a discredit upon their adversary, because he cannot at the
                                moment either disprove the facts, or reconcile them at once with his
                                own theory.—… This latter practice […] I conceive to be highly
                                disingenuous, and unworthy of the station and character of those who
                                frequently resort to it. Every one knows how difficult it is to make
                                the generality of men, especially of men who are engaged […] in
                                practical dealings, contemplate questions of this kind steadily and
                                impartially; a considerable effort is necessary to enable them to
                                abstract these ideas from the crowd of adventitious circumstances in
                                which they are always enveloped, and still more from the personal
                                interests involved in them. And when this end is accomplished for a
                                time, and the truth is perceived and acknowledged, how soon is the
                                attention exhausted, and the mind returns with pleasure to that
                                state of slovenly repose in which we are too apt to indulge. […]
                                Those extraneous particulars which have, by a laborious process,
                                been separated, in order to exhibit the main ingredient in its
                                unmixed form, soon rush together, and become blended as intimately
                                as before, when the scientific purpose is answered, and the powerful
                                test which had expelled them is withdrawn. There is, then, a strong
                                and constant tendency in the public mind to this confusion of the
                                simple elements of science, in the practical concerns of life: and
                                it is painful to see the authority of men, high in station,
                                employed, not to correct these errors, but to sanction and confirm
                                them. (p. 3)—… Dexterity in practice is by no means a criterion of
                                well-grounded knowledge. It is often acquired by the very neglect of
                                that knowledge; the attention which such knowledge demands being
                                profitably transferred to the rapid execution of measures, really,
                                but not apparently, connected with it. Thus, in all improved
                                machinery, the operation would be retarded, if the workmen were
                                continually</p><pb/>

                            The unfair mode is, without denying the principle, or questioning its
                            applicati connection with the case in hand, to alledge some particular
                            fact, or facts, apparently irreconcileable with the principle. This is
                            said to be unfair, first because it is an artifice to puzzle an
                            adversary, without <del>any assertion, make</del>? putting oneself to
                            the hazard of giving any opinion; it is taking therefore a mean
                            advantage. It is also chargeable with the vice of appealing to the
                            prejudices and weaknesses of practical men. It is unfair in this way
                            too, that it <del>is calculated to</del> gives an unfavourable
                            appearance to the <del>adversary’s</del> opposite side of the question,
                            without, in reality, contributing any thing to the decision. And that it
                            contributes nothing to the decision is certain from two circumstances;
                            first that it can hardly ever be known that the fact is correctly and
                            completely given; secondly, that it is too much to call upon a man at
                            the moment to <del>account for every fact which may be made to</del> see
                            through the puzzle of every fact which though really reconcilable to a
                            well-established theory, may yet wear the appearance of being
                            inconsistent with it.—It is painful when men whose education, whose
                            station, whose pretensions, and the rank to which they are raised in the
                            imaginations of men, might expect to _lead us to_ find in them the
                            patrons of clear and salutary conclusions; friends to the human mind,
                            are the patrons of ancient prejudices, the steady opposers of every
                            thing like progress; suspecting and hating whatever is proposed as a
                            means of exalting human nature. This is woeful, this is pitiable. This
                            is always provoking, and often hateful. <note>Edward Copleston, <emph>A

                            Words can be made more accurate than things. Four ounces are the double
                            of two ounces. Thus words are accurate in perfection. But you cannot
                            take two parcels of tea, for example, and say this is 4 oz., and that 2
                            oz.; and this is double of the other. You cannot be sure that the one is
                            exactly half of the other. You can never be sure, that the facts are any
                            thing more than an approximation to the truth of the words. “But, if to

                                only were to be sent to these outports, he would put a question to
                                the House, and ask, whether any of the members ever heard of two

                                been more fortunate than himself. He would appeal to his gallant

                        <p><emph>Theory and Practice</emph>. “Indolence often reposes, and

                                frequently and advanced so confidently, that to dispute them carries
                                the appearance of presumptuous paradox. Thus we are told of many
                                political maxims, that they are at once true in theory, and false in
                                practice. But this union of truth and falsehood, in the same
                                doctrine, applied to the same subjects, […] is wholly impertinent
                                and absurd. It only shews that the doctrine does not include what it

                                affairs; they have been considered as the effects of great
                                qualities, and as unattainable by men of the common level: Yet I
                                have not found many performances either of art or policy, that
                                required such stupendous efforts of intellect, or might not have

                        <p>Bentham once remarked—if we may believe
                        Bowring—that Mill’s “creed of politics results less from love for the many,
                        than from hatred of the few.” <note><emph>Works of Jeremy Bentham</emph>,

                        elucidation of that issue, and of the more important cognate one of
                        determining the intent and the meaning of Mill’s “Government.” What
                        certainly appears to be true, after a perusal of this section, is that in
                        writing § 9 of that essay, Mill had his tongue firmly in his cheek. Its
                        description of the refutation of the argument “that a perfect representative
                        system, if established, would destroy the monarchy and the House of Lords,”
                        is virtually the exact opposite of what either he, or for that matter,
                        Bentham, thought about the matter. But one may note that he did put the
                        argument in the hypothetical mode: “Suppose it true that, for the perfect
                        performance of the business of legislation and of watching over the
                        execution of the laws, a second deliberative assembly is necessary, and that
                        an assembly such as the British House of Lords, composed of the proprietors
                        of the greatest landed estates, with dignities and privileges, is the best
                        adapted to the end: it follows that a body of representatives … would
                        establish such an assembly if it did not previously exist.” Bentham’s
                        antipathy to second chambers is well known; here we have the evidence of
                        Mill’s views on the landed aristocracy.</p>
                    <p>One of his last, and little known, articles, “Aristocracy,”
                                <note><emph>London Review</emph>, (Jan. 1836)
                                II 283-306, signed
                            ‘PQ’</note> confirms his hostility to the upper
                        classes. But the comments and the language here are much stronger than in
                        any published work, and from the evidence in one of the final paragraphs
                        (see <ref target="cpb1ch9scrap121r">121r</ref>) it seems that his
                        radicality, on this issue at least, even intensified in the latter years of
                        his life. One should also note the remarks in <ref target="cpb5ch1">§ 1 of
                                <emph>CPB</emph> V</ref>, in an article that may definitely be dated
                        after December 1834, where he refers to both Houses of Parliament as the

                        <p><emph>Aristotle’s Opinion of Aristocracy</emph>. After stating that there
                            are four forms of Government, Democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and
                            monarchy, he says, “Democracy is a form of government in which
                                the offices are distributed by the people among themselves by lot;
                                in an oligarchy, by those who possess a certain property
                                qualification; in an aristocracy, by those who possess an
                                educational qualification, meaning an education that is laid down by
                                the law. [In fact, in an aristocracy, power and office are in the
                                hands of those who have remained faithful to what the law
                                prescribes, and who must of necessity appear best, whence this form
                                of government has taken its name.] <note>The omission of this
                                    passage by Mill does illustrate his cast of mind rather well. He
                                    had indicated its omission in the text by … .</note> In a
                                monarchy, as its name indicates, one man alone is supreme over all;
                                if it is subject to certain regulations, it is called a kingdom; if
                                it is unlimited, a tyranny.” [G] Aristot.,
                            <emph>Rhet</emph>., lib. I, c. 8. We see here, that what we usually call
                            an aristocracy, Aristotle calls an oligarchy, where the government is in
                            the hands of the great men—An aristocracy, where the government is in
                            the hands of the well instructed—where not riches and birth—but
                            education forms the title to govern. We see too, that between kingly
                            government and tyranny, the Greeks <hi rend="underline">did</hi> make a

                        <p>Inequality of ranks introduces an expensive way of living, and is
                            injurious to population and happiness. A coat of superfine cloth is not
                            better to wear in any sense, than a coarser; a fine carpet; fine plate,
                            than a coarse one or pewter. These are not articles which increase the
                            sum or intensity of physical sensations. They gratify the pleasure of
                            vanity, of consolation in respect to riches, merely. As there is less
                            inequality of ranks, there is less of this expense, which adds not to
                            physical enjoyment. As far as the increase of physical enjoyments go,
                            riches are good, farther they are not. This is injurious too, in another
                            point of view, the moral point of view. It turns _diverts_ emulation
                            from psychological qualities, moral and intellectual, to
                            riches.—Consider the evils of this.</p>

                                pre-eminence. I used to hate that king, and t’other prince—but,
                                alas! on reflection I find the censure ought to fall on human nature
                                in general. They are made of the same stuff as we, and dare we say
                                what we should be in their situation? Poor creatures! think how they

                        <p>Aristotle throughout speaks of aristokratiia [rule of the best born] as
                            being a government where those eminent for virtue are chosen to
                            rule—where those eminent for wealth are chosen, he calls it oligarxia

                                    diverges from aristocracy in the direction of oligarchy most
                                    signally in respect of a certain idea that is shared by the mass
                                    of mankind; they think that the rulers should be chosen not only
                                    for their merit but also for their wealth, as it is not possible
                                    for a poor man to govern well or have leisure for his
                                    duties.” See also § 7. “And whatever the holders
                                    of supreme power deem honourable, the opinion of the other
                                    citizens also is certain to follow them, and a state in which
                                    virtue is not held in the highest honour cannot be securely
                                    governed by an aristocracy.”</note></p>

                                principles. If by aristocracy they mean the peers, I have no vulgar
                                admiration, nor any vulgar antipathy towards them; I hold their
                                order in cold and decent respect. I hold them to be of an absolute
                                necessity in the constitution, but I think they are only good when
                                kept within their proper bounds. I trust, whenever there has been a
                                dispute between these Houses, the part I have taken has not been
                                equivocal. If by the aristocracy, which indeed comes nearer to the
                                point, they mean an adherence to the rich and powerful against the
                                poor and weak, this would indeed be a very extraordinary part. I
                                have incurred the odium of gentlemen in this house for not paying
                                sufficient regard to men of ample property. When, indeed, the

                                the last extremity and to a contest of blood—God forbid! God

                            honour and freedom, for a mean, timorous, shifting state of gaudy
                            servitude. … Their worth unhappily becomes venal. Equipages, Titles,
                            Precedencies, Staffs, Ribbons, and other such glittering ware, are taken
                            in exchange for inward merit, honour, and a character. … For insipid,

                            amiable and sweet honour, of a sincere and lasting relish and savour.

                            the nobility to the demand of the <emph>tiers etat</emph> about the mode
                            of voting, says, “They considered privileges, which were of no use but
                            to themselves, like that right of property which forms the basis of
                            general security. Privileges are sacred only when conducive to the
                            general advantage; it requires then some arguments to support them, and
                            they cannot be said to be truly solid, except when sanctioned by public
                            utility. But the chief part of the <emph>noblesse</emph> entrenched
                            themselves in the assertion, ‘So it was heretofore’—‘<emph>C’était ainsi
                                jadis</emph>.’ Particular circumstances, they were told, produced
                            that state of things, and these circumstances are entirely changed: in
                            vain—nothing could convince them. They were actuated by a certain
                            aristocratic foppery, of which an idea can be formed only in France; a
                            mixture of frivolity in manner, and of pedantry in opinion; the whole
                            united to a profound disdain for talent and information, unless enlisted

                            high rank are the greatest and most impudent of all liars. In the
                            Westminster elections in 1818 and 1819, there were examples which show
                            what I mean; and every man who has been any thing at all of an observer,
                            or a reader, will be able on recollection to make out abundance of
                            proof. They <del>Whigs, especially those of high rank</del> gave it out
                            and propagated with incessant industry, that Burdett’s money was the
                            cause of all the success which attended the popular cause. This was an
                            assertion, on the part of every propagator without proof, and being
                            calumnious, was tantamount to a lie—and the greater part of them could
                            not fail knowing it to be a lie; having good evidence that not one
                            farthing was spent but what was all accounted for—and being able to
                            reason, if endowed with a reasoning faculty, that bribery could not be
                            practised on the great mob of Westminster—and continue a secret.
                                <note>The reference is to the radical candidate, Sir Francis
                                Burdett, 1770-1844, MP for Westminster, 1807-37. In both elections
                                Mill was a member of Burdett’s election committee.</note></p>

                            the nobility, as long as they have any hopes of being able to <hi

                            no hope remains from force, the spirit of faction is replaced by

                                “they”</note> “The time at which he entered the world was critical
                            for national morals; the power of the great, lowered and restrained by
                            the despotic administration of Cardinal Richelieu, again sought to rise
                            against authority, but for the spirit of faction they had substituted
                            the spirit of intrigue.—Intrigue was different then to what it is now:
                            it was then associated with more vigorous manners and was used for
                            objects of greater importance. Men used it to make themselves necessary
                            or formidable. Now it is limited to flattering and pleasing. It gave
                            activity to the mind, to courage, to talents, even to virtue; now it
                            requires only suppleness and patience. There was something noble and
                            imposing in its access; it was domination and power. Now, small in its
                            views as in its means, variety and fortune are its motive and its end.
                            Its object was to unite men, now it isolates them. More dangerous then,
                            it embarrassed the admiration and checked the progress of good
                            government; now, favourable to authority, it shrivels souls and debases
                            morals.” [F]—Preface to the Edition of the <emph>Maximes</emph> du duc

                        <p><emph>The Aristocracy the Nation</emph>. The spirit of aristocracy is to
                            hold that out of ten, twenty, or thirty millions of men, ten thousand or
                                <del>less</del> so are the nation; that for them exclusively all the
                            benefits of the social order are designed, to them exclusively all the
                            benefits of the social order are due—the rest are made to be kept in a
                            state of use solely to the privileged few. To keep them in this state,
                            therefore, all engines must be set to work. As the power necessarily
                            rests with the many, and they would not allow an order of things so very
                            unfavourable to themselves, if they knew their power and how to make use
                            of it, the few have an interest to keep them as deeply as possible in
                            ignorance. <del>In order</del> To keep them in that state of degradation
                            which is most conformable to their interests, it is highly conducive to
                            make them be regarded, to make them even regard themselves, as vile, fit
                            for degradation, and incapable of enjoying a better state of existence.
                            It is therefore the interest of the aristocracy perpetually to vilify
                            the numerous class, to do every thing which lies in their power to make
                            them be regarded as objects both of hatred and contempt; to represent
                            them as gross, stupid, and mischievous; beasts from their ignorance and
                            appetites; devils from their desire to do mischief.</p>

                        inclined side of Mill’s mind. If he had written a book on law, it would have
                        been more a radical bourgeois critique of the nature of law, lawyers, and
                        judges, rather than a treatise on the need for law reform, complete with the
                        content of the proposed reforms, in the manner of Bentham. Further, his
                        interest in fallacies, and their influence in misleading the mind with
                        regard to political reform (see §§ <ref target="cpb3ch5">5</ref> &amp; <ref

                    <p>If Mill read and made notes on the work of Mercier de la Rivière in 1818, in

                        that his notes to be appended to the new edition of Bentham’s <emph>Théorie

                        <p>It has become recently a fashion, never to speak of judges but in the

                            This rage is carried to a very great height.—It is extremely pernicious.
                            It increases the arbitrary power of the judge. Never was confidence

                                violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown, in suits

                                individual and another. … Our law has therefore wisely placed this
                                strong and two-fold barrier, of a presentment and a trial by jury,
                                between the liberties of the people, and the prerogative of the
                                crown.”</note></p>

                        <p>On the complaint of Ld. Cochrane against the judge of the admiralty court
                            at Malta, Sir John Nicol said, the House should suspend its proceedings.
                            The accused was absent and he was a jude [judge]. This was about the
                            beginning of June 1811. I like not this extreme industry to screen the
                            conduct of judges from inquiry. It is of sinister augury. It looks as if
                            some infamous ends were proposed to [be] gained by the medium of judges,
                            by conduct which would not bear to be looked into. Sure it is, that if
                            in any government a design was taken to convert a free government into a
                            despotical one, the most useful step that could be taken, would be to
                            instil an opinion, that the conduct of judges was not to be looked into;
                            for if once the people could be persuaded to this, no instrument could
                            be conceived so effectual, as the judge’s power to effect the purposes
                            of the projecting despot. Why should not the conduct of judges be looked
                            into? Is it of less consequence to society that their conduct should be
                            good, than that of any other functionary? Are they less likely to crook
                            their conduct? <note>Nicholl, Speech on the Vice Admiralty Court of

                                1354ab, Loeb 5-7: “First of all, therefore, it is proper that laws,
                                properly enacted, should themselves define the issue of all cases as
                                far as possible, and leave as little as possible to the discretion
                                of the judges; in the first place, because it is easier to find one
                                or a few men of good sense, capable of framing laws and pronouncing
                                judgements, than a large number; secondly, legislation is the result
                                of long consideration, whereas judgements are delivered on the spur
                                of the moment, so that it is difficult for the judges properly to
                                decide questions of justice or expediency. But what is most
                                important of all is that the judgement of the legislator does not
                                apply to a particular case, but is universal and applies to the

                        <p>The magistrate, says Aristotle, should have a discretionary power, only

                            comprehendible in general rules, “while the ruler or rulers in office
                            should have supreme powers over matters as to which the laws are quite
                            unable to pronounce with precision because of the difficulty of making a
                            general rule to cover all cases.” [G] Aristot., <emph>Pol., l</emph>.

                        <p>“Ignorance of the causes, and original constitution of right, equity, law
                            and justice, disposeth a man to make custom and example the rule of his
                            actions; in such manner, as to think that unjust which it hath been the
                            custom to punish; and that just, of the impunity and approbation whereof
                            they can produce an example, or (as the lawyers which only use this
                            false measure of justice barbarously call it) a precedent; like little
                            children, that have no other rule of good and evil manners, but the
                            correction they receive from their parents, and masters; save that
                            children are constant to their rule, whereas men are not so; because
                            grown strong, and stubborn, they appeal from custom to reason, and from
                            reason to custom, as it serves their turn; receding from custom when
                            their interest requires it, and setting themselves against reason, as
                            oft as reason is against them: Which is the cause, that the doctrine of
                            right and wrong, is perpetually disputed, both by the pen and the sword:
                            Whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not so; because men care
                            not, in that subject, what be truth, as a thing that crosses no mans
                            ambition, profit or lust. For I doubt not, but if it [had] been a thing
                            contrary to any mans right of dominion, or to the interest of men that
                            have dominion, <emph>That the three angles of a triangle should be equal

                            their worm-eaten registers. If they there discovered a foolish or horrid
                            custom, they considered it as a sacred law. It was from this vile

                        <p>In the same preface (p. 4 to 19) Heineccius makes a strong display of the
                            importance of adducing the <hi rend="underline">reasons</hi> of laws.
                            “When there are two ways of expounding laws, one from their historical
                            origins, the other from the general principles of jurisprudence, not
                            everyone hitherto has thought the latter should be disregarded so much,
                            and in the same way many use the former in a manner scarcely more
                            satisfactory than if they had not used it, etc.” [L] He shews the abuse
                            of multiplied quotations of laws. And then of the method which consists
                            in giving the reasons, says, “These indeed are those foundations upon
                            which a certain and fixed law rest. This is also the Pole Star and if we
                            chart our course by it we easily avoid the sand banks and rocks on which
                            so many others are shipwrecked. This finally is the Lydian stone which,
                            once held, [we judge rightly concerning the interpretation of laws and
                            the decisions of cases. Wherefore I think the wisest men have put their
                            finger on it when they have thought the reason of the law to be its
                            spirit] and which once held they think is the salvation of their souls.”
                            [L] Of this opinion, he says, were Demosthenes and Cicero, from whose
                            oration <emph>pro A. Cæcina</emph>, he quotes a passage, that says it is
                            not only absurd but impudent to quibble about the words of a law when
                            you have the reason. Words in no language are sufficiently numerous to
                            give its own name to every thing. There is therefore much uncertainty in
                            words. “What statute, what senatorial decree, what magisterial edict,
                            what treaty or agreement or (to speak more of our private concerns) what
                            testament, what rules of law or undertakings or formal pacts and
                            agreements could not be invalidated and abolished, if we choose to
                            sacrifice the meaning to the words without taking into account the
                            design, the purport, and intention of the writer?” [L]

                            offence, a man might at one time be punished, at another declared
                            innocent; in which there is no equality of treatment, no certainty, etc.

                        <p>In English law, are contradictory decisions, contradictory maxims without
                            end. The use of them is admirable. It is, first of all, resolved, that
                            they are not contradictory: And then, as both are valid, and both
                            contradictory, any proposition in the world can be supported by them,

                            spirit brought him to follow blindly the method of the old
                            jurisconsults, even in the most absurd things. In all things he held
                            himself to the words and to the shell and in no case to the spirit which
                            they hid, followed the strict reading of the law, and he did not occupy

                            precisely, because the formulas had been for two centuries all the civil
                            law of the Romans; from which they concluded that to possess the
                            knowledge of the formulas and the art of using them, was to possess the
                            statute and case law. … The civil law supported itself on that base, it
                            was natural that it was the principal end of the study of the
                            jurisconsults. The spirit of these formulas being only constraining and
                            cunningly artful, it was natural that the jurisconsults occupied
                            themselves in improving upon that constraint and that cunning
                            artfulness. There was no science in this, for justice and equity were no
                            more strangers to each other than they were in jurisprudence: they were
                            there replaced by the games of words and formalities.” [F] Pilati,

                            supercilious behaviour, and the same incapacity for administration, to
                            what is it to be attributed? To a defect in their organization? No: but
                            to that of their instruction. All men practised in the finesse of
                            chicanery, and accustomed to judge only by precedent, ascend with
                            difficulty to the first principles of law: they extend the memory, and

                            it inspires them with a servile attachment to words, and it has focused

                            of course few law suits. The reason says Pilati is, because they have
                            expedients for making the course of procedure, more short, simple and
                            clear, than it is in other places. <emph>Ib</emph>., ch. 12, p. 90 [pp.

                        <p>The formalities of law, producing delay, vexation, and expense, “are the
                            price that each citizen pays for his liberty,” [F] says Montesquieu.
                            “His principle is false,” says Pilati; “and even if one had only the
                            example of the Romans, that example would suffice to destroy it. These
                            formalities, far from securing your honour and property, would furnish
                            to slanderers, judges, and advocates, a hundred ways of depriving you of
                            one and the other. There is nothing more simple than the ability to
                            dazzle the eyes of the public, and of committing a thousand injustices
                            under the veil of formalities. It is very difficult, to the contrary, to
                            impose on the public and on the superior [classes], in a procedure where
                            all is simple: the more there are envelopes, the easier it is to hide
                            what one wishes: for formalities are only envelopes.” [F]

                        <p>“The greatest of all the disorders which take place in the administration
                            of criminal justice today, is, in almost every country, the procedure
                            itself. Almost everywhere, a single judge hears the cause of the accused
                            in secret; he interrogates the accused in his own fashion, and when he
                            pleases; he wrangles with him, tires him, obstructs him, and confuses
                            him by his examination of the accused, he torments him by the horrors of
                            prison; he intimidates him by menaces; he deceives him by hopes; he
                            discharges him and then orders him brought back again; he forgets him in
                            prison, and remembers him again. In a word, the poor accused person is a
                            toy of the judge’s caprices, before being convicted of his crime.—That
                            judge examines the witnesses in the same way in secret; and by different
                            lures, he makes them often say more than they know. Every judge
                            persuades himself that it is a question of honour that those whom he
                            proceeds against appear criminal; every man prides himself in success in
                            his enterprises, and a criminal judge believes that his function is to
                            find culprits. He thus puts his entire energy into succeeding; and he
                            makes this effort more especially as no one, with the exception of the
                            Clerk of the court, who is always animated by the same spirit, is a
                            witness to his iniquities.” [F] … Having mentioned the publicity of the
                            English procedure, and the security of a jury, he adds, “that expedient
                            of English legislation prevents arbitrary judgements, and the tyranny of
                            the judges in sentencing, but it does not put hindrances to their
                            tyranny, in procedure, and it seems to me, in general, that it is more
                            important to prevent the arbitrary conduct of judges in procedure, than
                            to prevent arbitrary judgements; for it is rare to find judges so wicked
                            that they would condemn a man, who, following the law, deserved to be
                            acquitted, at least where it is not the question of some person who has
                            attracted the hatred of the sovereign, or of the government. But there
                            is nothing more odious than to see judges using a thousand cruelties,
                            and a thousand iniquities in procedure. Therefore it is that
                            disadvantage which must be principally remedied.” [F] Pilati, <emph>Loix

                        <p>“How often the worst scoundrels are not those who are judged, but those
                            who judge. If the latter are your friends, if they fear you, or if they
                            hope for something from you, they will sacrifice a thousand innocent
                            persons to you. If you have the misfortune to displease them, they will
                            protect, in defiance of you, all those whom you denounce to them as
                            criminal. They will free all those whom you have delivered into their
                            hands for their crimes. They will oppress innocence and foment crime, to
                            the extent of their passions. Travel across all Italy; there is not a
                            village, no matter how small it be, where you will not run into examples
                            of the wickedness of judges, of every genre. In the other countries of

                            rare. That is still a pressing reason to take away from the judges every
                            means of acting according to their fancy, not only in the infliction of
                            punishments, but again principally in procedure.” [F]

                        <p>“There has been much written in recent times against the severity of
                            punishments. … But in criminal procedure the vigour of the punishments
                            used today in Europe is perhaps the least of all the evils. … The wrong
                            done to a man in making him experience a punishment more severe than his
                            crime merits, is nothing near as great as the wrong done to the innocent
                            person, dragged to prison, maltreated there for a long time, and by
                            every sort of cruelty at last found guilty. In the first case, the wrong
                            is even perhaps nothing, if it is the law, and not the judge which
                            inflicts the severe corporal punishment. The law being known is common
                            to all; and only the guilty will suffer the punishment however severe it
                            be. In the second case, the wrong comes from the barbarity, perfidy and
                            wickedness of the judge. Thus the greatest vice of criminal law is the
                            non elimination of the judge’s liberty of insulting or outraging
                            innocent persons. In Germany, for example, and in Italy, as soon as a
                            judge wishes to do evil to someone, who has not done any to society, he
                            has only to open the infamous works of [B.] Carpzov and of Farinace [P.
                            Farinaccius]; he will find there a thousand ways of tormenting the
                            innocent. Also, he can never have a lack of pretext for persecuting, nor
                            of ways of harassing, to his taste, the most honest men.—On the other
                            side, if a judge wishes to follow his fancy and without appearing to
                            violate the laws, he may save and set free those who are found truly
                            guilty of some crime. This is another considerable fault in criminal
                            legislation. So it would be better then, if there were not any laws at
                            all; for, in this case, they are only the toys of the judges, and the
                            bane of innocent persons.” [F] <emph>Ibid</emph>., 106, 107.

                            whereof the child knows that he cannot be ignorant:—these are so many
                            lessons of immorality, which cannot fail to corrupt a young mind. To
                            correct a child when one is in a passion, gives him an example of two
                            vices at once, rage, and revenge: for all correction of this kind is
                            likely to be, and to the sufferer will appear to be, excessive; and seem

                            duty, and his good. Honour and shame are, as formerly observed, much
                            more liberal motives, and experience proves, that they may for the most

                            judge and counsel. “In circuit practice there is need of an exquisite
                            knowledge of the judge’s humour, as well as [his] learning and ability
                            to try causes; and his lordship was a wonderful artist at nicking a
                            judge’s tendency, to make it serve his turn, and yet never failed to pay
                            the greatest regard and deference to his opinion: for so they get
                            credit; because the judge, for the most part, thinks that person the
                            best lawyer that respects most his opinion. I have heard his lordship
                            say that sometimes he hath been forced to give up a cause to the judge’s
                            opinion, when he was plainly in the wrong, and when more contradiction
                            had but made him more positive; and besides that in so doing he himself
                            had weakened his own credit with the judge, and thereby been less able
                            to set him right when he was inclined to it. For, when he found it went
                            against the grain, he would not teaze, as the way is, to get credit with
                            the countrymen, who would be apt to say, Look what pains he takes; but
                            for that time, since there was no remedy, let the matter go. And all
                            this without blame with respect to his clients, for he could do no more
                            in any respect, but might do worse by many. And a good opinion so gained
                            often helps at another time, to good purpose, and sometimes to ill
                            purpose; as I heard it creditably reported of Serjeant Maynard that
                            being the leading counsel in a small-feed cause, would give it up to the
                            judge’s mistake, and not contend to set him right, that he might gain
                            credit</p><pb/>

                            tolerably digested; and so they came to nothing. And besides, the matter
                            being a subject of great skill as well as foresight in the law, the
                            gentlemen of the country are afraid, and hearken to the learned as when
                            they settle their estates. And such learned gentlemen—admitting they
                            were willing to it—(as for the sake of interest in practice they are
                            reputed not to be)—they would be scrupulous enough; but, being averse,
                            they raise a mist of scruple upon every such bill, and represent the
                            possibility of frauds in the offices to be so dangerous to men’s titles,
                            that the country gentlemen, who do not take upon them to judge, and will
                            trust nobody, fly back; and there falls the bill. … But, as to those
                            tremendous frauds that are so much exaggerated by some, I must needs
                            alledge that records of every court of justice are obnoxious to ten

                        <p>“In his lordships conduct of trials, he was very careful of three
                            matters. 1. To adjust what was properly the question, and to hold the
                            counsel to that; for he that has the worst end of the staff is very apt
                            to fling off from the point, and go out of the right way of the cause.
                            2. To keep the counsel in order; for in trials, they have their parts
                            and their times; his lordship used frequently to inculcate the decorum
                            of evidencing practice. 3. To keep down repetition, to which the
                            counsels, one after another, are very propense; and in speaking to the
                            jury one and the same matter, over and over again, the waste of time
                            would be so great, that, if the judge gave way to it, there would scarce
                            be an end; for most of the talk was not so much for the causes, as for
                            their own sakes, to get credit in the country for notable talkers. And
                            his lordship often told them, that their confused harangues disturbed
                            the order of his thoughts; and, after the trial was over, it was very
                            hard for him to resume his method, and direct the jury to comprise all
                            the material parts of the evidence. Therefore he was positive not to
                            permit more than one counsel, of a side, to speak it to the jury, by way
                            of summing up the evidence; and he permitted that in such a way as made
                            them weary of it; for in divers sorts of trials he wholly retrenched it;
                            and when he observed much stiffness, and zeal of the parties, in a
                            cause, then, after the evidence was over, he would say, Come, make your
                            speeches, and then sat him down; and that looked with a sort of contempt
                            of their talents, which gave them a distrust, and discomposed their
                            extempore, so much, that for the most part they said, No, we will leave
                            it to your lordship. And thus the abuse, by fastidious talk, wore away,
                            and the practice before him was so well known, as it became, at length,
                            a pure management of evidence, and argument of law.” <emph>Ib</emph>.,

                            “He made a great difference in the nature of causes. For, if there was a
                            suspicion of fraud, false dealing, or forgery, he was a most strict
                            examiner, and would canvas the evidence to a scruple, giving all
                            latitude to the counsel to refine, and suggest, where he might if
                            possible lay hold of a thread in order to get a clear solution of the
                            fact. For it was not enough that he, in his private opinion, thought a
                            deed forged, or the like; but he must have evidence, by the force of
                            which he might shew it so plain, as would satisfy the auditory as well
                            as the jury. And after all, if he could not arrive at that, he let it
                            go, and directed the jury upon the case, as it stood upon the evidence
                            whatever it was. I wondered once to find him, after an hours sticking
                            and picking upon an evidence, at last all at once give it up. I asked
                            him, why he left off so abruptly. He told me that he discerned a
                            roguery; but the evidence was not sufficient to justify him to direct
                            the jury to find, even contrary to his own private judgement.”

                            oven himself, and knew where to look for the party. Serjeant Maynard was
                            a very able practiser, and used to lay traps for the judges, and very
                            cunning ones; but if he discerned that he was observed, he straight gave
                            it up, and contended not upon a falacy, which he foresaw could not be

                            jury was prepared so far. … When you have proved, said his lordship, I
                            will tell you what I think, and not before. For his lordship knew that
                            way of evidencing to be a sure sign that the proof did not come up to
                            the point; and so must be supplied by opining and concessions before

                            made a heavy complaint of this witch, and said that if she escaped his

                            was a better practiser than a judge. For, being made chief justice of
                            the kings bench, he had a towering opinion of his own sense and wisdom,
                            and rather <hi rend="underline">made</hi> than declared law. I have
                            heard his lordship say that, in making law, he had outdone king, lords,
                            and commons. This may seem strange to such as see not the behaviour of
                            judges, and do not consider the propensity of almost all to appear wiser
                            than those that went before them.” <emph>Ib</emph>., ii, 122[-3].</p>

                            will use an artful conduct, may find plausible colours to sustain or
                            baffle almost any cause: as may be done even amongst us, for if a judge
                            will take a liberty to presume on the one side, and hold the other to a
                            strict proof, the cause goes which way he pleaseth.” The Hon. Roger

                            according to right. […] If the suitors or the cause be considerable, and
                            no present at all is given, the judge looks upon himself to be slighted,
                            or rather defrauded, for he accounts something due to him for doing
                            justice, not much unlike what is here termed fees.” <emph>Ib</emph>.</p>

                            harmless, honest witness, that doth not know his play, cannot so well
                            stand his many captious questions, as a false witness, used to the trade

                            and can clear himself where the other will be confounded; therefore, if

                                is, that every man is his own Bailiff and Summoner, without the

                                singular one, is that no Man answers by Attorney, but in proper
                                Person only. … The <emph>Turkish</emph> Law seems to have another
                                Virtue, which lies in the Method of Proof. After the Judge hath
                                heard the Demand, and the Answer; he considers on which side the
                                Proof lies. … Decrees or Decisions never fight one with another. …
                                All Equity is comprehended in it. Men, there, are bounded by their
                                Contracts, as well as here; but, if a Contract proves very unequal,
                                the Judge takes notice of the Reasonableness, and gives Relief. …

                                <emph>Boswell</emph>. You say, Dr. Johnson, that Garrick exhibits
                            himself for a shilling. In this respect he is only on a footing with a

                            nonsense or absurdity, if the case requires it. Garrick refuses a play

                            obligation of having a knowledge based upon evidence of the justice and
                            of the necessity of the laws, and of being their defender, is
                            inseparable from the state of the magistrate considered as an organ of
                            the laws, the same obligation is even more rigourously placed upon the
                            magistrate considered as judge, as minister of justice, from whom the
                            positive laws ought to be only the results.—Can any one honestly contest
                            that as soon as an injustice is evident, it is permitted to any man to
                            lend his ministry to it? … Alas! what will become of humanity if the
                            evidence of <emph>absolute</emph> justice does not make men follow the
                            strict <emph>obligation</emph> of not lending their ministry to a
                            violation of it. … If you destroy the just and unjust absolutes, and
                            consequently the evidence of the <emph>absolute</emph> duties, and the
                            absolute obligation of never deviating in contempt of their evidence, I
                            defy you to imagine any means of giving some consistency to society; I
                            defy you to institute a power that can spread itself without running the
                            risk of destroying itself; I defy you to establish a power in which the
                            individual and the authority are secure, etc.” [F] Mercier de la

                            incident of such judicature, that whatever it decides is <emph>de

                        <p>Given Mill’s interest in philosophy, and his

                        throughout), a fairly substantial body of material could be assembled on

                            upon the whole, generical utility, utility as regards the genus, utility
                            as regards the species, universal utility, the universals of utility—all
                            these are names for utility as applicable to human nature, in general,
                            to the common attributes of human nature—to what of that nature is held
                            in common by the species. <hi rend="underline">Particular utility</hi>,
                            or <hi rend="underline">practical utility</hi>, are names for that
                            utility which is applicable to what any particular people have different
                            from others—it is general utility, modified by the specific
                            difference.—This with regard to the case—the genus or species, call it
                            what you will. The same terms may also be applied in regard to a
                            particular people. You may talk of abstract utility with regard to the
                            people of England. In this sense it means not only what is good for the
                            species, but what is suited to the <del>circumstances of the</del>
                            English people, as a people, without considering existing
                            institutions—practical utility is the general utility, bating the
                            inconvenience of change. Abstract utility is what would be good for a
                            people if there were no inconvenience in change—practical utility is
                            what is best for them, allowance made for the inconvenience of change.
                            Absolute utility is what would be good for a people, at the commencement
                            of a political state, when every thing is to [be] institute[d]. When
                            they have institutions, practical utility is this absolute utility,
                            bating when the inconvenience of change would surpass the good which the
                            forms of absolute utility could introduce.</p>

                            “And my personal opinion is, that those who govern others must gauge
                            their every act by this one test—the greatest happiness of the governed.
                            … And indeed it is the duty not only of one who governs allies and
                            citizens, but also of one who governs slaves and dumb animals, to be
                            himself a slave to the interests and well-being of those he governs.”

                            expedient for the republic, than to have admitted that they were just,

                            it to contribute to the ruin of the state; consequently, he retained his
                            command for four months longer than the time fixed by the people.” [L]

                        <p>Dr. Johnson quotes a passage from Soame Jenyns, on the origin of Evil, in
                            which that writer give <hi rend="underline">utility</hi>, as that which
                            constitutes the distinction between right and wrong, moral and immoral
                            in human conduct. This, says Johnson, is “a criterion of action, on
                            account of virtue and vice, for which I have often contended, and which
                            must be embraced by all who are willing to know why they act, or why
                            they forbear to give any reason of their conduct to themselves or
                            others.” Review of a Free Inquiry, etc., Johnson’s <emph>Works</emph>,
